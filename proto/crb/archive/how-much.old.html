<h2 id="h-1">How CRB is taxed</h2>
	<p>After the CRA withholds a 10% tax at source, the actual payment you get is $900 per 2-week period.</p>
	<h3><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> Example</h3>
	<!--insert caculation-->
	<ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
		<li><span class="mrgn-tp-0 text-muted h5"><span class="nowrap">$1,000</span></span> (CRB gross amount)
								 </li>
		<li class="brdr-bttm"><span class="fas fa-minus fa-li"><span class="wb-inv">minus</span></span> <span class="text-muted h5">&nbsp;&nbsp;$100</span> (10% tax withheld at source)

	</ul>
<h3>Expect an adjustment at tax time</h3>	
<p>The 10% tax may not be all the tax you need to pay. You may need to pay more (or less), depending on your personal tax situation.</p>

<p><a href="#h-3">What do to at tax time</a></p>
				 
<h2 id="h-2">If you earn over $38,000</h2>
<p>If you earn more than $38,000 net income in the calendar year, you will need to reimburse some or all of the benefit at tax time.</p>
<p>You will have to reimburse <strong>$0.50 of the CRB for every dollar of net income you earned above $38,000</strong> on your income tax return. You will not have to reimburse more than you received that year.</p>
	
	<details>
        <summary>Net income includes</summary>
         <p><strong>Net income</strong> includes all amounts that are normally considered part of net income for income tax purposes. This includes line 23600 of your tax return (excluding the CRB amounts) with some adjustments for split income and certain repaid amounts.

<h2 id="h-3">What to do at tax time</h2>
<p>The CRA will provide you with a T4A tax information slip before March 10, 2021 for the CRA-administered COVID-19 benefit amounts you received in 2020. Your T4A slip will also be available in CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>You must report your CRB payments that you receive as income when you file your personal income tax return.</p>

<h3>Verify your tax slips</h3>
<p>All COVID-19 benefits from the CRA and any provincial or territorial payments that you received in 2020 will be shown on one T4A slip.</p>
<p>If you applied for multiple benefits or made repayments, verify that the amounts on your T4A slip are correct before you report them in your tax return.</p>
<p><a href="http://test.canada.ca/cra/cops/t1/covid19-1-e.html#h_2">Verify COVID-19 amounts on your T4A</a></p> 

<!--- Will switch to ajax once the id's are added to the other page --->
<h3 id="h_3">Report T4A amounts on your tax return</h3>
<p>If you received a T4A slip, your COVID-19 benefit amounts are shown in <span class="nowrap"><strong>boxes 197 </strong>to <strong>204:</strong></span></p>

<details>

</details>

<p>Add up each COVID-19 benefit payment amount you received from your T4A slip and enter the total amount on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-13000-other-income.html">line 13000</a> of your tax return.</p>
<p>In the space to the left of line 13000, specify the type of income you are reporting. If you are filing a paper return and received more than one benefit, attach a list of all benefits received.</p>

<h4 id="h_2_2">Report the income tax deducted at source</h4>
<p>If you received the CRB, CRCB or CRSB, the CRA withheld a 10% tax at source on each payment. Enter the income tax deducted from <strong>box 022 </strong>on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-43700-total-income-tax-deducted.html">line 43700</a> on your 2020 tax return.</p>
<p>Quebec residents will get both a T4A and RL-1 slip. The 10% tax withheld at source will be split between the 2 tax slips, 5% will be reported on the T4A slip and the other 5% will be reported on the RL-1 slip.</p>

<h4 id="h_2_3">If your income is tax exempt</h4>
<p>If your income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, for details go to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/aboriginal-peoples.html">taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</a>.</p>

<h3>If you need to reimburse CRB</h3>
<p>If you received the CRB and your net income is more than $38,000 (excluding CRB amounts), you may have to reimburse some or all of the benefit.</p>
<p>Any amounts you need to reimburse will be included as part of your total balance owing for your 2020 taxes.</p>

<details>
<summary>If you're filing a paper return</summary>
<p>If you're filing a paper return and line 23400 is <strong>more than <span class="nowrap">$38,000</span></strong>, use the chart for line 23500 on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">worksheet for the return</a> to calculate the social benefits repayment amount you need to reimburse.</p>
<p>You will have to reimburse $0.50 of the CRB for every dollar of net income you earned above $38,000.</p>
<p>How to calculate the social benefits repayment on the worksheet</p>
<ol>
   <li>Enter applicable amounts on lines 1 to 24</li>
   <li>Insert your CRB amount on <strong>line 25</strong> (from box 202 on your T4A slip)</li>
   <li>Subtract your CRB amount from line 24 and enter the difference on line 26</li>
   <li>Subtract $38,000 (the base amount) from line 26</li>
   <li>Take the subtracted amount and multiply by 50%</li>
   <li>Use the CRB amount or the 50% calculation (whichever is less) to calculate the amount for line 23500</li>
   <li>Enter this amount on both <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23500-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 23500</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-42200-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 42200</a> of your tax return</li>

<p>You <strong>do not</strong> have to attach the worksheet to your return, but keep it for your records.</p>
</details>

<details>
<summary>If you're filing electronically</summary>
<p>If you're filing electronically with certified tax software, the amounts you need to reimburse should be calculated for you and added to your balance owing.</p>
</details>

<h3>Interest and penalties</h3>
<p>Interest relief will be given to individuals who, in 2020, had a total taxable income of <span class="nowrap">$75,000</span> or less and received at least one of the COVID-19-related income support benefits , including the CRB.</p>
<p>If you meet the criteria and have filed your 2020 tax return, the CRA will automatically apply interest relief on your 2020 taxes owing. You will not have to pay interest on any amount owing from your 2020 taxes until <span class="nowrap">April 30, 2022</span>.</p>
<h4>File your taxes on time</h4>
<p>Late filing penalties still apply.  File your tax return before the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals/filing-dates-tax-return.html">due date</a>. If you file late, you will be charged a <span class="nowrap">5% late-filing</span> penalty on top of what you already owe, plus an additional 1% for each month (up to a maximum of 12 months).</p>
