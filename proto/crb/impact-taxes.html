<h2 id="h-1">How CRB is taxed</h2>
	<p>After the CRA withholds a 10% tax at source, the actual payment you get is $900 per 2-week period.</p>
	<h3><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> Example</h3>
	<!--insert caculation-->
	<ul class="fa-ul lst-spcd">
		<li><span class="mrgn-tp-0 text-muted h5"><span class="nowrap">$1,000</span></span> (CRB gross amount)

	</ul>
<h3>Expect an adjustment at tax time</h3>	
<p>The 10% tax may not be all the tax you need to pay. You may need to pay more (or less) depending on your personal tax situation.</p>

<p><a href="#h-3">What do to at tax time</a></p>
				 
<h2 id="h-2">If you earn over $38,000</h2>
<p>If you earn more than $38,000 net income in the calendar year, you will need to reimburse some or all of the benefit at tax time.</p>
<p>You will have to reimburse <strong>$0.50 of the CRB for every dollar of net income you earned above $38,000</strong> on your income tax return. You will not have to reimburse more than you received that year.</p>

<h2 id="h-3">What to do at tax time</h2>
<p>The CRA will provide you with a T4A tax information slip at tax time for the CRA-administered COVID-19 benefit amounts you received in 2020. Your T4A slip will also be available in CRA <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-individuals/account-individuals.html">My Account</a>.</p>
<p>You must report your CRB payments that you receive as income when you file your personal income tax return.</p>

<h3>Verify your tax slips</h3>
<p>All COVID-19 benefits that you received from the CRA in 2020 will be shown on one T4A slip, or on your RL-1 if you live in Quebec.</p>
<p>If you applied for multiple benefits or made repayments, verify that the amounts on your T4A slip are correct before you report them in your tax return.</p>

	<p>Provincial or territorial COVID-19 financial assistance payments will be on separate T4A slips.</p>

<h3 id="h_3">Report T4A amounts on your tax return</h3>
	<p>If you received a T4A slip, your CRB amount is shown in <span class="nowrap"><strong>box 202</strong></span>. Other COVID-19 benefit amounts are in boxes 197 to 204:</p>

</details>

<p>Add up each COVID-19 benefit payment amount you received from your T4A slip and enter the total amount on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/personal-income/line-13000-other-income.html">line 13000</a> of your tax return.</p>
<p>In the space to the left of line 13000, specify the type of income you're reporting. If you're filing a paper return and received more than one benefit, attach a list of all the benefits you received.</p>

<h4 id="h_2_2">Report the income tax deducted at source</h4>
<p>If you received the CRB, CRCB or CRSB, the CRA withheld a 10% tax at source on each payment. Enter the income tax deducted from <strong>box 022 </strong>on <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-43700-total-income-tax-deducted.html">line 43700</a> on your 2020 tax return.</p>
	
	<p>For Quebec residents, the 10% tax withheld at source is split:</p>

	<!--<p>Quebec residents will get both a T4A and RL-1 slip.

<h3>If you need to reimburse CRB</h3>
<p>If you received the CRB and your net income is more than $38,000 (excluding CRB amounts), you may have to reimburse some or all of the benefit.</p>

<p>Any amounts you need to reimburse will be included as part of your total balance owing for your 2020 taxes.</p>

<details>
<summary>If you're filing electronically</summary>
<p>If you're filing with certified tax software, the amounts you need to reimburse should be calculated for you and added to your balance owing.</p>
</details>
	
<details>
<summary>If you're filing a paper return</summary>
<p>If line 23400 is <strong>more than <span class="nowrap">$38,000</span></strong>, complete section "Line 23500 – Social benefits repayment" of the worksheet to calculate how much you need to reimburse.</p>
	<p>Use the worksheet that applies to you:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/tax-packages-years/general-income-tax-benefit-package/5000-d1.html">worksheet for the return (for all except non-residents)</a>

		</ul>
	</p>
<p>You will have to reimburse $0.50 of the CRB for every dollar of net income you earned above $38,000. You will not have pay back more than what you received in CRB benefits for that year.</p>
	<p><strong>How to calculate the social benefits repayment on the worksheet</strong></p>
<ol>
   <li>Enter applicable amounts on lines 1 to 24</li>
   <li>Insert your CRB amount on <strong>line 25</strong> (from box 202 on your T4A slip)</li>
   <li>Subtract your CRB amount from line 24 and enter the difference on line 26</li>
   <li>Subtract $38,000 (the base amount) from line 26</li>
   <li>Take the subtracted amount and multiply by 50%</li>
   <li>Use the CRB amount or the 50% calculation (whichever is less) to calculate the amount for line 23500</li>
   <li>Enter this amount on both <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-23500-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 23500</a> and <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/deductions-credits-expenses/line-42200-social-benefits-repayment.html">line 42200</a> of your tax return</li>
</ol>

<p>You <strong>do not</strong> have to attach the worksheet to your return, but keep it for your records.</p>
</details>

<h3 id="h_2_3">If your income is tax exempt</h3>
<p>If your income is eligible for tax exemption under section 87 of the Indian Act, your CRB payments may be tax exempt. Your CRB payments will be taxed (or not) in the same way as the income that entitled you to the benefit.</p>
<p>
	<ul> 
		<li>If all your income was tax exempt during the time you earned the $5,000 income requirement (in 2019 or the last 12 months), then the benefit is also tax exempt. 
		<li>If your income during that time was not fully tax exempt, you may have some tax to pay. 
	</ul></p>
<p>All CRB payments had a 10% tax was withheld at source. If your CRB payments in 2020 were tax exempt, you may be able to get some or all of that tax back by <strong>filing a 2020 tax return</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are not sure if your income is tax exempt, or need more details:</p>  
<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/aboriginal-peoples.html">Taxes and benefits for Indigenous peoples</a></p>
	
<h3>Penalties and interest</h3>
<p>File your tax return before the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/important-dates-individuals/filing-dates-tax-return.html">due date</a>. If you file late, you will be charged a <span class="nowrap">5% late-filing</span> penalty on top of what you already owe, plus an additional 1% for each month (up to a maximum of 12 months).</p>
		    
<h4>Interest relief</h4>
<p>Interest relief will be given to people who have a taxable income of <span class="nowrap">$75,000</span> or less in 2020, and received at least one of the COVID-19  benefits, such as the CRB.</p>
<p>You must file your 2020 tax return to qualify for interest relief.</p>
