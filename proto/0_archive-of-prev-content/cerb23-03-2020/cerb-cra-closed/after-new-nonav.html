    </ul>
    <p>To ensure you continue to receive the support you need, the Government of Canada is proposing to implement 3 new benefits: the Canada Recovery Benefit, the Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit, and the Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit. Service Canada is also temporarily changing the rules for Employment Insurance (EI).</p>

<h2 id="h1">Determine the right benefit for you</h2>
<p>If you continue to need income support after the CERB ends, first find out if you qualify for the new simplified Employment Insurance (EI) benefit, available as of September 27, 2020.</p>
<p>For those not eligible for EI, such as self-employed and gig economy workers,  the new Canada Recovery Benefit will provide $800 (before taxes withheld) per 2-week period, for up to 26 weeks.</p>
<h2 id="h2">EI or Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB)</h2>

<ol class="lst-stps">
<li><h3>First, determine if you qualify for Employment Insurance (EI)</h3>
<p>Service Canada is temporarily changing the EI rules to allow more people affected by COVID-19 to qualify.</p>
<p>You may get a minimum rate of $400 per week for up to 26 weeks.</p>
<details><summary>Check simplified eligibility for EI</summary>
<ul>
<li>Only need a minimum of 120 insurable hours (in which you paid into EI) for EI
regular benefits</li>
<li>Get a minimum rate of $400 per week for up to 26 weeks</li>
<li>You can still work, but your benefit will reduce by $0.50 for every dollar you earn (up to
90% of previous weekly earning)</li>
<li>If you qualify, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/benefits/ei/ei-regular-benefit.html">apply for simplified EI </a>after September 27, 2020</li>
</ul>
  <!--<p>These changes are pending legislation passing in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>
  <p>More information will be available after that.</p>-->
</details>
</li>

<li><h3>Second, if you don't qualify for EI, the proposed Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB) may be right for you.</h3>
<p>The proposed CRB would provide income support to employed and self-employed individuals whose income is directly affected by COVID-19. This benefit would be for people who are ready to work and looking for work, but who <strong>do not qualify</strong> for the new Employment Insurance (EI) benefits.</p>
  <p>This benefit is pending legislation passing in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>

</li>
</ol>
  <h2 id="h3">Caregiving and sickness recovery benefits</h2>
  <p>If you’re not able to work due to your health or caregiving responsibilities related to COVID-19, you may be eligible for one of these other proposed recovery benefits.</p>
    <p>These benefits are pending legislation passing in the House of Commons and Senate.</p>

<h3>Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB)</h3>
<p>The proposed CRCB would provide income support ($500 per week, for up to 26 weeks per household) to employed and self-employed individuals who are not able to work because they are caring for a young child or family member who requires supervised care. This only applies if their regular school, facility, or program is closed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>For more information, go to <a href="http://test.canada.ca/covid-19-guidance/proto/crcb/onepager.html">Canada Recovery Caregiving Benefit (CRCB)</a>.</p>

<h3>Canada Recovery Sickness Benefit (CRSB)</h3>
<p>The proposed CRSB would provide $500 per week for up to 2 weeks, for employed and self-employed individuals who are not able to work because they’re sick or need to self-isolate due to COVID-19.</p>
