    <h2 id="h-1">When to report the CRHP on your return</h2>
    <p>The CRHP is considered government assistance and is taxable, unless you are exempt from income tax. As an employer who received the CRHP, you must report the subsidy on your income tax or information return for the tax year (fiscal period) in which you are considered to have received it.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>The CRHP is <strong>generally considered to have been received on the last day of the claim period it relates to</strong>. </p>
      
    </div>
		<p>For example, if you applied for and received the subsidy for claim period 20 (August&nbsp;29 to September&nbsp;25, 2021), we would consider you to have received the amount on September 25, 2021, even if you applied for period 20 in 2022 or received your subsidy amount for period 20 at a date later than September&nbsp;25, 2021.</p>
    <h2 id="h-2">How to report the CRHP on your return</h2>
    <p>How you report the CRHP on your tax or information return depends on the type of employer you are.</p>
    <p>You may be able to elect to reduce your related wage expenses by the amount of government assistance (CRHP) you received. Otherwise, you have to include the assistance in your income. </p>
    <h3 id="h-2-1">Corporations</h3>
	  <p>Report the amounts of CRHP you received for the tax year on both Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (T2SCH1) and the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>
	  <p>On the GIFI, include the CRHP you received at line 8242. </p>
	  <p>On Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (T2SCH1):</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>On line 605, include a short description, clearly identifying each COVID-19 subsidy you received </li>
		  <li>On the corresponding line 295, enter “0” </li>
		  <li>If you are a member of a partnership, ensure to reflect any CRHP amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 129, “Income or loss for tax purposes – partnerships”</li>

    <h3 id="h-2-4">Individual employers</h3>
    <p>If you are an individual who has received a CRHP amount as an eligible employer, you will report the total amount you received on the statement of activities form(s) that apply to your situation.</p>
    <h4>Sole proprietors (unincorporated, self-employed individuals) and partners in a business partnership</h4>
    <p>Include the total CRHP amount you received for the tax year on line 8230, “Other income” of form T2125, Statement of Business or Professional Activities. </p>
    <h4>Self-employed farmers</h4>
    <p>Include the total CRHP amount you received for the tax year on line 9600, “Other income” of form T2042, Statement of Farming Activities.</p>

    <h4>Partners in a partnership</h4>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="h-2-5">Tax-exempt employers</h3>
    <p>If you are an income tax-exempt entity (such as a registered charity or a non-profit organization) that has received a CRHP amount as an eligible employer, you may have to report the total amount you received on the information return (if any) that applies to your situation, even though this amount is not taxable to you.</p>
    <h4>Registered charities</h4>
    <p>Use the T3010, Registered Charity Information Return, to report a CRHP amount you received as income.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered charity that does not have to complete Schedule 6, you can report CRHP amounts you received as income by checking “Yes” at line 4565, “Did the charity receive any revenue from any level of government in Canada?” of Section D and including the total CRHP amount you received for the fiscal period on line 4570.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, include the total CRHP amount you received for the tax year on line 4540, “Total revenue received from federal government” of Schedule 6.</p>

    <h4>Registered Canadian amateur athletic association</h4>
    <p>There is no particular line on form T2052, Registered Canadian Amateur Athletic Association Information Return, to report the CRHP. The financial statements for the fiscal period covered by the return should indicate the different sources of revenue in enough detail to show how funds were spent and invested.</p>

    <h4>Other tax-exempt eligible employers</h4>
    <p>If your organization is required to file the T1044, Non-profit Organization (NPO) Information Return, include the total CRHP amount your organization received for the tax year on line 101, “Federal, provincial, and municipal grants and payments” of your  NPO Information Return. For more information on whether the organization you represent has to file a NPO Information Return, see guide T4117, Income Tax Guide to the Non-Profit Organization (NPO) Information Return.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="h-3">No GST/HST reporting requirements</h2>
    <p>CRHP amounts you received are not considered taxable supplies.</p>
    <p>Do not include these amounts on the GST/HST return.</p>
        <h2 id="h-6">Employees report income as usual</h2>
    <p>Employees who received income supported by CRHP do not need to take any special action when completing their returns.</p>
    <p>Employment income will appear on the T4 as usual, whether the employer used the CRHP to pay the wages or not. Employees should report this income on the individual tax return at line 10100 <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">according to the T4 instructions</a>. </p>
    <p>There are no T4A slips issued for CRHP, as there are for COVID benefits paid directly to individuals.</p>
