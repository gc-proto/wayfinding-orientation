		<h2 id="a0"><mark>Getting a COVID-19 test near you</mark></h2>
		<p>Contact your local health authority about testing if you:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>think you may have COVID-19</li>
			<li>have been in contact with someone who has COVID-19</li>
			<li><mark>are looking for your test results</mark></li>
		
		</ul>
		
			<p><mark>Testing for outbound international travel is also delivered by many private clinics.  You may be charged a fee for these travel-related tests.</mark></p>
			
		<p><a href="../symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html"><mark>Find local health authorities in your province or territory</mark></a></p>
		
	
		
		<h2 id="a2">Contact tracing</h2>
		<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, a public health official will ask you questions to collect important information about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>your symptoms</li>
			<li>activities and travel you did before you tested positive</li>
			<li>all the people you may have been in close contact with while you were contagious</li>
		</ul>
		<p>This is called contact tracing. It's a key public health measure to slow down or stop the spread of the virus.</p>
		<p>By tracking down your contacts, public health officials can warn people that they may have been exposed to the virus. This helps your contacts take measures to self-isolate and monitor themselves for symptoms to prevent further spread.</p>
		<h3>COVID Alert</h3>
		<p>Consider downloading and using the <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/covid-alert.html">COVID Alert app</a>.  It can let people know of possible exposures before any symptoms appear.</p>
		<p>You can help slow the  spread of infection and prevent future outbreaks.</p>
		
		
		<h2 id="a1">Why testing is important</h2>
		<p>Testing is the only way we can confirm if you have COVID-19. Knowing you're infected is important to protect your family and the people you encounter.</p>
		
		<p>Testing helps reduce the spread of the virus. When someone tests positive for COVID-19, they can be isolated at home or, if needed, in a hospital.</p>
		<p>Testing tells us:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>who has the infection</li>
			<li>where in our communities the virus is spreading</li>
			<li>how much the virus may be circulating in our communities</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Testing is a key tool to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>find and isolate people who have COVID-19, to prevent the spread to others and to prevent outbreaks</li>
			<li>follow up with close contacts of cases so that they can self-isolate, monitor for symptoms and get tested</li>
			<li>know how many people are infected, which helps us understand the level of risk in a community</li>
			<li>inform the public health actions that are put in place</li>
			<li>help us to better understand this virus</li>
		</ul>
