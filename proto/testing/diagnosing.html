			<h2 id="a1"><del>Deciding who should get tested</del></h2>
			<p><del>People with COVID-19 can have:</del></p>
			<ul>
			  <li><del>mild symptoms</del></li>
			  <li><del>severe symptoms</del></li>
			  <li><del>no symptoms at all (also known as asymptomatic)</del></li>
			</ul>

			  <li><del>symptoms</del></li>
			  <li><del>underlying medical conditions</del></li>
			  <li><del>risk of exposure to the virus</del></li>
			</ul>
			
			
			<h2 id="a2"><mark>Different ways</mark> we test for COVID-19</h2>
			
			<p>In Canada, there are different ways to test and analyze results for COVID-19. As laboratories and public health officials integrate new tests and technologies, they will determine the right test for you. </p>
			<p>Currently, all tests must be performed by a health care professional. At this time, we haven’t authorized at-home test kits (where you collect the sample and do the test yourself at home).</p>

		</ul>
		
		
			<h2 id="a3">Tests to find out if you currently have COVID-19 (diagnostic test)</h2>
			<p>Tests such as molecular polymerase chain reaction (or PCR) tests detect the virus itself and diagnose COVID-19. If you’re being tested for a possible current case of COVID-19, you’ll receive one of these tests.</p>
		
		
		
			<h3>How samples are collected</h3>
			<p>There are different ways samples can be collected to test for COVID-19. Samples can be collected through a:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>nose swab </li>
			  <li>throat swab</li>
			  <li>saliva sample </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>How samples are tested to detect the virus</h3>
			<p>For laboratory-based testing, such as molecular PCR:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>samples are sent to a laboratory for analysis</li>
			  <li>results are generally provided in 1 to 3 days</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For point-of-care testing:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>sample collection and testing is done at the time and place of care, such as a hospital or doctor's office</li>
			  <li>results are provided while you wait</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Point-of-care technology can only test a limited number of samples in a single machine. Because of this, it's used in places where it's needed most, including:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>rural, remote and isolated communities</li>
			  <li>specific high-risk settings where it's important to have fast test results without having to send samples to a laboratory</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A positive laboratory-based or point-of-care test means that you currently have COVID-19.</p>

			<h2 id="a4">Tests to find out if you’ve been infected by COVID-19 (antibody test)</h2>
			<p><a href="/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/medical-devices/testing/serological/information-for-patients.html">Antibody (serology) tests</a> use a sample of your blood to check for antibodies. Your body makes these after it's exposed to the virus.</p>
			<p>A positive serology test means that, at some point, you were infected by the virus. But it can't tell how long ago you were infected.</p>
			<p>Serology tests aren't used to diagnose COVID-19 in early stages of infection, since they don't detect the virus itself.</p>
			<p>Serology tests can help:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>estimate how many people have had COVID-19</li>
			  <li>better understand how much the virus has been spreading in the community</li>
			  <li>determine which public health measures need to be in place</li>
			</ul>
			<p>On April 23, 2020, Canada launched the <a href="https://www.covid19immunitytaskforce.ca/" rel="external">COVID-19 Immunity Task Force</a> to lead a Canada-wide unified effort to perform serological tests. To determine the groups of Canadians who will receive serology testing as a first priority, the task force is coordinating with: </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>provinces and territories</li>
			  <li>institutions </li>
			  <li>research groups</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="a5">Re-infection and immunity</h2>
			<p>We’re aware that other  countries are reporting re-infection cases from different strains of the virus. </p>
			<p>We don’t yet know if  those who have recovered from COVID-19 are safe from re-infection. Other  respiratory viruses generally don’t provide people with 100% immunity after  recovery, so it’s important to determine:&nbsp; </p>
			<ul>
			  <li>how long protection lasts </li>
			  <li>whether it’s possible for individuals       to experience <strong>less</strong> severe or       potentially <strong>more</strong> serious       illness if they get COVID-19 a second time</li>
			</ul>
			<p><a href="https://www.covid19immunitytaskforce.ca/" rel="external">Canadian  scientists</a> are working to:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>assess if those who have recovered from       illness are safe from re-infection </li>
			  <li>understand how the immune system reacts       to the virus</li>
			  <li>understand the rate and consequences of       re-infection </li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Confirming re-infection </h3>
			<p>COVID-19 re-infection  is hard to confirm. This is because people may continue to <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/testing/accuracy.html#a3">test  positive by PCR</a> for several  weeks or, more rarely, months, after recovery. Specialized testing is usually  required to confirm re-infection from different strains of the virus.  Researchers need to analyze the virus’ complete genetic material.</p>
			<p>There remains much uncertainty around possible re-infection. Those who  have recovered should take the same <a href="/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">actions  to prevent COVID-19</a> as someone who has never  had the infection. </p>
