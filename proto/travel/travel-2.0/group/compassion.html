   <p id="site">You can request a limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons as part of your
      compassionate entry application. You will need additional permission from the site you're visiting.</p>

   <p>A Site Visit Authorization Form&nbsp;isn't&nbsp;required if you're visiting a public outdoor setting or site, for
      example, a funeral in a public park.</p>


   <p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. This
      means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or territory may have
      additional restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and provincial or
      territorial travel restrictions, you must comply with those that is are the most stringent.</p>
   <p>Before applying, please check provincial or territorial requirements and check back often to find out if any of their
      quarantine requirements prohibit limited release from quarantine.</p>
