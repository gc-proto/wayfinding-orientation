               follow testing and quarantine requirements. The measures keep
               Canadians safe, particularly given the new COVID-19 variants in Canada and around the world. Follow the

               <summary>If you need to leave your place of quarantine for compassionate reasons</summary>
               <p>You need to request an exemption for a limited temporary release from mandatory quarantine
                  to:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>attend a funeral or end of life ceremony</li>

                  fines and penalties for putting others at risk.</p>
               <p>You won't need to submit a request if you're visiting a public outdoor setting or site, for example, a funeral in

                  <h3>Provincial and territorial restrictions</h3>
               <p>Before applying, please check provincial or territorial requirements. Check back regularly as these restrictions can
                  change.</p>


               <p>Some provinces and territories may not allow release from
                  quarantine for compassionate
                  reasons. This
                  means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada, a province or
                  territory may have
                  additional restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and
                  provincial or
                  territorial travel restrictions, you must comply with those that is are the most stringent.</p>
