	<summary id="compassionate">Compassionate reasons: limited release for funerals, to care for someone, or for end-of-life visit</summary>
	<p>Based on your reason for travel, you may apply for a limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. If you’re approved, your limited release from quarantine is valid only for the location(s) and purpose specified in your application</p>
	<p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. This means that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or territory may have additional restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and provincial or territorial travel restrictions, you must comply with those that are the most stringent.</p>
	<p>To apply for compassionate entry and limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons, see <a href="/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/compassion">Caring for others, funerals and support</a>.</p>
