<p><strong>All travellers 5 years of age or older</strong>, regardless of citizenship, must provide proof of a negative
    COVID-19 test result. </p>
<p>There are <strong><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/covid-vaccinated-travellers-entering-canada">no
            exceptions for vaccinated travellers</a></strong>, at this time. </p>
<p>You must:</p>
<ul>
    <li>take a test before you leave the United States within 72 hours of your entry into Canada (your test must be
        performed in the United States)</li>
    <li>provide one of the accepted types of tests, <strong>not an antigen test</strong></li>
    <li>keep proof of your test results for the 14-day period that begins on the day you enter Canada</li>
</ul>
</p>

<details>
    <summary><span id="recovered-test-positive">If you’ve recovered from and continue to test positive for
            COVID-19</span></summary>
    <p>Persons who have recovered from COVID-19 can continue to test positive long after they have recovered and are no
        longer infectious. </p>
    <p>Travellers who have previously tested positive for COVID-19 <strong>must provide proof</strong> of a
        <strong>positive</strong> COVID-19 molecular test conducted between 14 and 90 days prior to your entry into
        Canada.</p>
</details>

<details>
    <summary><span id="accepted-tests">Accepted types of tests</span></summary>
    <p>These tests are considered acceptable molecular tests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PCR - Polymerase chain reaction</li>
        <li>RT-PCR – reverse transcription real time PCR</li>
        <li>Quantitative PCR (qPCR)</li>
        <li>Nucleic acid test (NAT) or Nucleic acid amplification test (NAATs)</li>
        <li>Reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP)</li>
        <li>Isothermal amplification</li>
        <li>Droplet digital PCR or digital droplet PCR (ddPCR)</li>
        <li>Transcription-mediated amplification (TMA)</li>
        <li>RNA (Ribonucleic acid)</li>
        <li>Ct (cycle threshold) </li>
        <li>CRISPR</li>
        <li>Sequencing</li>
        <li>Next generational sequencing (NGS) or whole genome sequencing (WGS)</li>
        <li>Oxford Nanopore sequencing (LamPORE)</li>
        <li>Detection of the N gene</li>
        <li>Detection of Orf1a/b</li>

        <li>Detection of the E gene</li>
        <li>Detection of the RdRp gene</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These tests use methods such as a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab, nose swab, or saliva sample. At this time, proof of
        having a vaccine will not replace a negative test result.</p>

        <li>A person who enters Canada if the entry is necessary to return to their habitual place of residence in
            Canada after carrying out an everyday function (such as getting groceries, going to work, or seeing a

    <p>Making a false declaration when entering Canada at the land border, including the presentation of a fraudulent

<p>Switch Health has been hired by the Public Health Agency of Canada to manage the COVID-19 test kits at all land

<h2><span id="arrival-testing">Arrival testing</span></h2>

<p>If you’re entering Canada at the land border crossing, you’ll get 2 COVID-19 At Home Specimen Collection kits: one to
    use on the day you arrive in Canada and another to use on Day-8 of our mandatory quarantine.</p>
<p>Your kits contain all of the instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Do not open your swab or tube</strong> until you are instructed to do so by a telehealth healthcare provider.
    This can cause contamination, or result in a delay in receiving your test result. </p>

<h2 class="h3" id="arrival-test-border">Completing your arrival test at the border</h2>
<p>Some border crossings offer on-site services to help you with your test kit. At these locations, you’ll be guided
    through specimen collection, including how to take a nasal swab yourself and how to package the specimen for
    testing.</p>
