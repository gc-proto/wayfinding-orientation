<h3>Other types of care for family members</h3>

<p>At this time, Canada is <strong>not permitting entry</strong> to foreign nationals for any other care providing reasons.</p>

<p>Foreign nationals cannot enter Canada to provide:</p>
<ul>
   <li>childcare for your relatives</li>
   <li>support when your family member is already in a healthcare facility or has other care support</li>
   <!-- <li>what else?</li>-->
</ul>

<p>You may still be able to enter Canada to reunite with immediate family.</p>
<p><a href="family.html">Foreign nationals reuniting with immediate family</a></p>

<h3>Canadians returning to or travelling within Canada</h3>
<p>If you are a Canadian citizen, permanent resident of Canada, person registered under the Indian Act, or a
   protected
   person, you
   are allowed to enter Canada. Some provinces and territories have entry restrictions in place that
   could
   limit your ability to travel to provide care, childcare and other support.</p>

<p>You must comply with:</p>
<ul>
   <li><a href="isolation.html#quarantine">mandatory quarantine requirements</a> if returning to Canada</li>
   <li><a href="provinces.html">provincial or territorial restrictions</a> if travelling within Canada</li>
</ul>

<!-- mark we could have a list of NO examples -->
 <!-- <mark>double check, workshop seemed to say was U.S. entry was exempt... but Emily's feedback say no, confirm. Provincial/territorial would still apply - need to add link</mark> -->

      <h2 id="funerals">Funerals, sitting vigil and family support</h2>

<p>We recognize that this is a very difficult time for families who are facing grief and loss of loved ones.</p>

<p>However, for foreign nationals, attending a funeral or sitting vigil <strong>alone isn't enough reason</strong> to enter Canada at this time.</p>


<details><summary>Coming from the U.S. (directly or indirectly) as a foreign national</summary>
<p id="funerals-US"> You must provide
   compelling reasons why your entry is necessary at the time of entry into Canada for consideration. You must also explain how you plan to meet the 14-day mandatory
   quarantine requirements.</p>


<h3 class="h4">Examples of reasons why your entry may be allowed</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>Executor of the deceased's estate or will</li>
      <li>Providing emotional support or care for remaining family in Canada that can only be done in person</li>
      <!-- <li>Any other details that may strengthen your case that your presence is necessary (including proof of your
         relationship to the person)</li> -->
   </ul>



<h3 class="h4">Examples of meeting quarantine</h3>
   <ul>
      <li>You can complete the mandatory quarantine period before the funeral</li>
      <li>You are staying with family or friends as long as you will not expose individuals that are not part of your travel group, and you will not be in contact with a person at risk of more severe outcomes from COVID-19</li>
    <!--  <li>You'll be sitting vigil in a private setting (such as at the person's home), and have written permission to quarantine with the person</li>-->
