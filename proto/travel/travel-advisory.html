    <h2>Understand requirements if you plan travel</h2>
    <p>Canadians who must travel abroad should plan how they'll meet Canada's travel requirements upon their return, and make plans for the possibility of needing to extend their stay at their destination.</p>
    
    <p> Travellers who are authorized to enter
      Canada must follow all testing, quarantine and reporting requirements.</p>
  
        
    
    <h2>Before you travel</h2>
    
    <p><strong>Do not travel if you:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>have symptoms of COVID-19, even if mild</li>
      <li>are in quarantine or isolation</li>
      <li>have been diagnosed with COVID-19</li>
      <li>are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19</li>
      <li>have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>If you're well and must travel:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>check for COVID-19 testing and other entry requirements for your destination country</li>
      <li>check the Travel Advice and Advisories page for your destination<ul>
          <li><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories">Travel Advice and Advisories</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>ensure you'll be able to obtain a COVID-19 test at your destination prior to returning to Canada, and meet all other requirements in the Flying or Driving to Canada checklists</li>
      <li>find the contact information for the Canadian embassy or consulate closest to your destination and keep the information with you, in the event that:<ul>
          <li>there is an unforeseen lockdown, or</li>
          <li>local health services become overwhelmed</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>check with your <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/documents/travel-insurance">travel insurance</a> provider and make sure you're covered for:<ul>
          <li>COVID-19-related medical expenses</li>
          <li>other non-COVID-19 emergency-related expenses</li>
          <li>trip interruption</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>make sure you meet requirements to <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying#within">board a flight in Canada</a></li>
      <li>plan ahead for delays to your return home, including the financial implications and the practical arrangements (e.g. flight re-booking, etc.) you may need to make</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>During your travel</h2>
    <p>Use multiple personal preventive practices at once (i.e., a layered approach) to protect yourself and others from COVID-19. With the increased circulation of some variants of concern that can spread more easily, it is even more important that
      you strictly follow recommended personal preventive practices.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Stay informed of the local COVID-19 situation, be prepared and follow local public health advice.</li>
      <li>Isolate for 14 days if you're experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, even if mild. If you think you have COVID-19, follow local public health advice regarding seeking care.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Know where to go for medical care, including a COVID-19 test.</li>
      <li>Properly wear a well-constructed and well-fitting <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">mask</a> when recommended,
        such as when:<ul>
          <li>you're in a shared space (indoors or outdoors) with people from outside your immediate household;</li>
          <li>you're advised by the local public health authority.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Minimize non-essential in-person interactions with people from outside your immediate household or close travel group. If you have to interact with people you don't live with, make sure interactions are:<ul>
          <li>as few and as brief as possible</li>
          <li>from the greatest physical distance possible</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Avoid <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#r">closed spaces (with poor ventilation) and crowded places</a> when with people from outside of your immediate
        household. When possible <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/guidance-documents/guide-indoor-ventilation-covid-19-pandemic.html#a10">improve indoor air</a> quality in shared
        spaces through increased ventilation.</li>
      <li>Avoid common greetings, such as handshakes.</li>
      <li>Limit contact with <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/people-high-risk-for-severe-illness-covid-19.html">people at risk of more severe disease or outcomes from COVID-19</a>, like older
        adults and those with underlying medical conditions or compromised immune systems.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html">Wash your hands often</a> with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds.<ul>
          <li>Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing at least 60% alcohol) only if soap and water are not available. It's a good idea to always keep some with you when you travel.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform respiratory etiquette by covering your mouth and nose with your arm to reduce the spread of germs.<ul>
          <li>If you use a tissue, dispose of it as soon as possible and wash your hands afterwards.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/publications/diseases-conditions/cleaning-disinfecting-public-spaces.html">Clean and disinfect</a> surfaces and objects that you frequently touch.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Returning to Canada</h2>
    <p><strong>Do not travel if you:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>become sick with symptoms consistent with COVID-19, even if mild, prior to your planned return to Canada</li>
      <li>have been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the last 14 days</li>
      <li>are waiting for the results of a lab test for COVID-19</li>
      <li>have been in close contact with someone who has or is suspected to have COVID-19</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Air travellers are required to undergo a health check prior to boarding. In the event that the air operator observes that the air traveller has COVID-19 symptoms, the air operator will be required to refuse to board the person for travel for a
      period of 14 days or until a medical certificate is presented that confirms that the symptoms that the person is exhibiting are not related to COVID-19.</p>
    <p>Measures that require all air passengers to wear a well-constructed, well-fitting and properly worn mask to cover their mouth, nose, and chin during travel are in effect. Some airlines may conduct a temperature check prior to boarding.</p>
    <p>To learn more about boarding requirements:</p>
    <p><a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travel-covid/travel-restrictions/flying">Boarding flights to and within Canada</a></p>
    <p>If you feel sick or experience any symptoms of COVID-19 during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, you must inform the flight attendant or a Government of Canada screening or quarantine officer immediately.</p>
    <p>If you don't have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone with COVID-19, report this information to a screening or quarantine officer on arrival in Canada. This is required under the <em>Quarantine Act</em>. The screening or
      quarantine officer will provide instructions for you to follow.</p>
    <p>Work your way through the checklist to understand all of the requirements:</p>
