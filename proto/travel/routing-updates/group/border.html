<h2 id="expectations">What to expect on entry</h2>

<p>Temporary border restrictions on entry into Canada continue. Unless exempted, if you do not have a
non-discretionary (non-optional) reason to travel to Canada, a Border Services Officer will deny you
entry. Foreign nationals with symptoms will <strong>not be allowed to enter Canada</strong>.</p>




   <!-- <p>First, you should determine whether or not you can enter Canada.</p> -->


      <a href="./wizard-start.html" class="btn btn-call-to-action">Find out if you can travel to Canada</a>

      

<h3 id="arriveCAN">Submit your information using ArriveCAN</h3>
 
<p>As of March 31, 2020, when seeking entry into Canada by any mode (air, land, marine or rail), you must provide your contact
   information to a Border Services Officer through:</p>
   <ul>
      <li>the ArriveCAN mobile app <strong>or</strong></li>
      <li>the ArriveCAN accessible web-based form
         <strong>or</strong></li>
      <li>a paper form</li>
   </ul>
   </li>

   <p>The Canada Border Services Agency collects this information on behalf of the Public
   Health Agency of Canada to help enforce compliance with the 14-day quarantine or isolation requirement.</p>


     

   <p>We encourage you to get our mobile app prior to arrival to reduce wait times and limit contact at the border.</p>

      <p>Get the <strong>ArriveCAN</strong> mobile application (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/canarrive/id1505394667?mt=8"

            Use this mobile app to speed up your arrival process in Canada and spend less time with border and public

            officers. Submit your information easily and securely using the app within <strong>48 hours before</strong>

         <li>reduce your wait time and points of contact at the border</li>

      </ul>
   </details>




      <h3>How we screen travellers</h3>
      <p>We assess all travellers, no matter their country of origin, upon arrival to Canada. Entry screening is one of
         many
         important public health tools. It is part of a multi-layered government response strategy.</p>
      <p>When you arrive in Canada at an air, land, marine or rail border, a Border Services Officer will ask you:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>what the purpose of your visit is</li>
         <li>whether you are feeling ill or unwell</li>
         <li>other questions as needed to complete their assessment</li>
      </ul>
      <p><abbr>CBSA</abbr> officers will look for signs of illness, regardless of how you respond to screening questions.
         Officers will refer any traveller they suspect is ill for a further medical assessment by the Public Health Agency
         of
         Canada.</p>

         <p>All travellers entering Canada are given a Public Health Agency of Canada handout with
         instructions to quarantine for 14 days.</p>

         <p>You <strong>must</strong> wear a <a
            href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">non-medical
            mask or face covering</a> upon arrival in
            Canada. Masks or face coverings may be provided upon arrival as appropriate.</p>

</ul>

   <h3>False information and compliance with the Emergency Order</h3>
   
   
   <p>Providing false information is <strong>considered misrepresentation</strong> and has consequences. If you provide
      false immigration
      information or false information about the purpose of your travel, you may be denied entry and/or be banned from
      returning to Canada.</p>

   <p>You may travel through Canada to Alaska by land for non-discretionary (non-optional) reasons, but there are strict entry conditions.</p>

   <p>You will need to have proof your entry into Canada is not optional, such as:</p>

<p>Before travelling you must:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>make your travel arrangements to transit through Canada <strong>well in advance</strong></li>
            <li>make flights and connections as direct as possible to limit your contact in Canada; multiple domestic connections
               may not be considered appropriate</li>
            <li>make connections that are as short as possible; if your connecting flight is more than 24 hours apart you will
               need to quarantine (self-isolate) until your next flight</li>
            </ul>
<p>While travelling you must:<p>
   <ul>
            <li>remain in the secure transit area of a Canadian airport to complete your connection; if you leave the airport you
