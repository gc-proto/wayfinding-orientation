            <p>If you can enter Canada and <strong>you have no symptoms</strong>, you must <strong>quarantine</strong> for 14 days. This is mandatory and starts from the date you arrive in Canada. A <strong>negative</strong> COVID-19 test result at any point during your quarantine does not exclude you from the requirement to quarantine, unless you are part of an approved federal and provincial quarantine project.</p>

            <p>Should you develop symptoms or test positive for COVID-19 during quarantine, you must begin isolation for an additional

           <h3 id="plan">Your quarantine plan</h3>

        <p>As a traveller, you <strong>must</strong> demonstrate that you have an adequate plan for quarantine. You are expected to make plans, within your own means, in advance of your arrival at ports of entry to Canada. <strong>Foreign nationals</strong> who do not have an adequate plan may be denied entry into Canada.</p>

        <p>As of November 21st, 2020, it is mandatory to have a quarantine plan.</p>
    <p>You will be asked questions about your plans for quarantine upon arrival.</p>



<details>
    <summary>Where can you quarantine</summary>

    <ul>
        <li>You must quarantine in a place where you won't have contact with people who:
            <ul>
                <li>are 65 years or older</li>
                <li>have underlying medical conditions</li>
                <li>have a compromised immune system</li>

        </li>
     <li>You'll need access to the basic necessities of life, including water, food and medication without leaving quarantine, and heat during the winter months</li>

    </ul>
        <p>You may only quarantine with somebody from the above group if:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>they consent to the quarantine or are the parent or minor in a parent-minor relationship</li>
                <li>you complete a form provided by a government representative at the port of entry explaining the consent and
                    receive authorization to proceed</li>
            </ul>


    </ul>


   <p>Many travellers will be able to quarantine at home or at their Canadian destination.</p>

   <p>Some travellers may be unable to quarantine at home or their final destination. In these cases, travellers are expected to
    make alternative arrangements for their return to Canada. Although alternative accommodations (e.g. with family or
    friends, or paid accommodation) may be suitable, the Government of Canada does not reimburse for expenses incurred for
    accommodations, including hotels, RV rentals and trailer park or campground fees.</p>


            <h4>You cannot quarantine in group living environments</h4>

       <ul>
          <li>stay in your room to avoid contact with others</li>
          <li>practice physical distancing (maintain a 2-metre distance)</li>

<details><summary>Limited (temporary) release from quarantine for compassionate reasons (for funerals, to care for someone, or for an end of life visitation)</summary>
<p>Based on your reason for travel, you may apply for a limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. If
you’re approved, your limited release from quarantine is valid only for the location(s) and purpose specified in your
application.</p>

<p>Some provinces and territories may not allow for limited release from quarantine for compassionate reasons. This means
that even if you receive approval from the Public Health Agency of Canada a province or territory may have additional
restrictions. In the event of conflicting requirements between federal restrictions and provincial or territorial travel
restrictions, you must comply with those that are the most stringent.</p>

<details><summary>How to request a letter of interpretation</summary>

<p id="request-ex">If you would like to request a letter of interpretation that provides an assessment as to whether your <strong>future</strong> travels <strong>may</strong> qualify for an exemption under one of the Emergency Orders under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, please submit your request in writing to the Public Health Agency of Canada at: <a href="mailto:phac.emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca"
    target="_blank">emergencyorder-decretdurgencecovid19.aspc@canada.ca</a>.
</p>



<p>Note that there is currently a high volume of requests, and response times are delayed. <strong>Submit your request well in advance</strong> of your travel dates, as it can take up to a month or more to receive a response. </p>

<p>The response email may be presented to the government representative at the port of entry during <strong>your next crossing</strong> to facilitate their decision as to whether an exemption applies in your case. </p>

<p> To support a thorough analysis, include the following information, at minimum:</p>
<ul>
    <li>number of travellers and country of citizenship of each traveller</li>
    <li>planned travel dates/frequency of travel</li>
    <li>specific purpose for travel to Canada</li>
    <li>an explanation as to why you believe your travel to Canada qualifies for an exemption under the Emergency Orders. Include any relevant information to support the explanation. <strong>Do not include any personal or sensitive information</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for the development of the Emergency Orders pursuant to the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>, government representatives are responsible for administering the Emergency Orders at Canada’s ports of entry. </p>
<p>As such, permission to enter Canada, or exemption from quarantine, is granted by a government representative, who is required to consider the information provided at the time of entry to determine whether a person should be permitted entry into Canada, or be exempt from quarantine. This includes reviewing travel documentation (for example, a valid passport and work permit, a letter of invitation from an employer), the quarantine plan for the arriving traveller, and any relevant exemptions.</p>
<p>A letter of interpretation from PHAC would be taken into account, but would not guarantee entry or exemption from quarantine requirements.

    COVID-19 in Canada.</p>

    <h3>Consequences for failure to comply with the Emergency Order</h3>

    <p>Failure to comply with this order is an offence under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite> and could lead to <strong>imprisonment and/or fines</strong>.</p>
