               <h5>Stage 1: We check your eligibility</h5>

               </ul>
               <p>If your application passes this first stage, we’ll let you know in your online account. This doesn’t guarantee
                  that we’ll approve your application and issue you a study permit.</p>
               <p>Our aim is to pass most applications through stage 1 before the fall semester starts.</p>
               <h5>Stage 2: We check your application for admissibility and any changes to your eligibility</h5>
               <p>In this stage, an officer reviews your application for:</p>

                  <li>any information that changed after we reviewed your application for eligibility</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If your application passes this second stage, we’ll approve it.</p>
               <p>At this point, when current travel restrictions change, you’ll be:</p>
               <ul class="lst-spcd">
                  <li>ready to travel to Canada and begin your studies, or</li>
                  <li>able to continue your studies in Canada, if you’ve already started studying online</li>
               </ul>

			<li>you have a study permit</li>
			<li>you’ve been approved for a study permit</li>
			<li>you applied for a study permit before starting your study program in the spring, summer or fall 2020 semesters, or</li>
			<li>you will apply for a study permit before starting your study program in the January 2021 semester</li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you’re in this situation, you can begin your classes while outside Canada and:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>complete 100% of your program online if:
				<ul>
					<li>your program is between 8 and 12 months in length, and</li>
					<li>you started your studies between May and September 2020</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>complete up to 50% of your program online (until April 30, 2021) if you complete the other 50% of your program in Canada</li>

			<li>complete up to 50% of your studies online (until April 30, 2021) if:
				<ul>
					<li>you’ll graduate from 2 different eligible study programs within 2 years of each other</li>
					<li>1 of the programs started between May and September 2020</li>
					<li>each program is at least 8 months long, <strong>and</strong></li>
					<li>you complete at least 50% of the combined length of the programs in Canada</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>


		<p><strong>If you apply for your study permit before starting your program</strong>, any time spent studying online from outside Canada since spring 2020 now counts toward the length of a post graduation work permit. (Before, only the time spent studying online after you were approved for a study permit counted.)</p>


		<p>You won’t have time deducted from the length of your post-graduation work permit for studies you complete outside Canada until <strong>April 30, 2021</strong>.</p>
