            <p>As of March 30, 2020, all passengers flying in Canada will be subject to a health check prior to boarding.</p>
            <p>You will not be permitted to board if you:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>show any symptoms of COVID-19 <strong>or</strong></li>
                <li>have been refused boarding in the past 14 days due to a medical reason related to COVID-19 <strong>or</strong>
                </li>
                <li>are subject to a provincial or local public health order</li>
            </ul>

               <p>If you have symptoms of COVID-19, you will <strong>not</strong> be allowed to board any flight until:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li>14 days have passed <strong>or</strong></li>
                  <li>you present a medical certificate confirming that your symptoms are not related to COVID-19</li>
               </ul>
               <p>If you have signs or symptoms consistent with COVID-19, you will not be allowed to use public transportation to
                  travel to the place where you will isolate.</p>
<!-- 
               <h2>Crossing provincial and territorial borders</h2>
               <p>You may be subject to additional provincial or territorial public health
                  measures at your final destination.</p>
               <p>For more information, see <a href="./group/provinces.html">Provincial and territorial restrictions</a>.</p>
               
            <h2>Arriving from outside of Canada</h2>
            <p>Health checks before boarding also applies to travellers arriving from <strong>outside Canada</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>If you are arriving from outside Canada and are deemed safe to fly, you may board a connecting flight to your
               destination.</p>
            <p>However, upon arrival at your final destination, you must go directly to the place where you will isolate, and remain
               there for 14 days. This is because you are still at risk of developing symptoms and infecting others.</p>

    <h2 id="must-travel">If you must travel during the pandemic</h2>
    <p>Take <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#p">precautions against respiratory illnesses</a>, and seek medical attention if you become sick.</p>
    <p>During your trip:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>avoid <a href="https://travel.gc.ca/travelling/health-safety/mass-gatherings">large crowds</a> or crowded areas</li>
        <li>avoid contact with sick people, especially if they have a cough, fever or difficulty breathing</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/healthy-living/your-health/diseases/benefits-hand-washing.html">wash your hands</a> often with soap under warm running water for at least 20 seconds
            <ul>
                <li>use alcohol-based hand sanitizer (containing 60% alcohol) if soap and water are not available and always keep some with you when you travel</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>practise proper <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks.html#hygiene">cough and sneeze etiquette</a></li>

   <h2 id="a4">Non-medical masks or face coverings while travelling</h2>
   <p>All air travellers, with some exceptions, are required to wear a <a
         href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/prevention-risks/about-non-medical-masks-face-coverings.html">non-medical

      <li>people who have trouble breathing</li>
      <li>people who are unable to remove the mask without assistance </li>
   </ul>
   <p>In all other modes of federally regulated transportation, operators may require travellers to wear a non-medical mask
      or face covering whenever possible. This may be the case when interacting with others, and when they cannot maintain
      a distance of 2 metres.</p>
   <p>Before you travel, check for updates to see how <a

    <h2 id="mon">Monitor your health</h2>
    <p>If you become sick, avoid contact with others except to see a health care professional.</p>
    <p>If you feel sick during your flight to Canada or upon arrival, inform the flight attendant or a Canadian border services officer.</p>
    <p>If you do not have symptoms but believe you were exposed to someone who was sick with COVID-19, report this information to a Canada border services agent on arrival in Canada. This is required under the <cite>Quarantine Act</cite>. The Canada border services agent will provide instructions for you to follow.</p>
    <p>You will see messaging on arrivals screens at international airports to help guide you if you are experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
    <p>Arriving travellers will also be provided with information on what symptoms to identify and how to <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/diseases/2019-novel-coronavirus-infection/symptoms/provincial-territorial-resources-covid-19.html">contact local health authorities</a>.</p>
