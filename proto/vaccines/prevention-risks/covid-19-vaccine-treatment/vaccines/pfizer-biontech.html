		<h2 id="a1">About the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine</h2>
		<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 mRNA vaccine (Tozinameran or BNT162b2) is used to prevent COVID-19. This disease is
			caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).</p>
		<p>The vaccine is approved for people who are 16 years of age and older. Its safety and effectiveness in people
			younger than 16 years of age have not yet been established.</p>
		<p>The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine is manufactured by Pfizer Canada ULC and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH. Health
			Canada authorized this vaccine with conditions on December 9, 2020, under the <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/interim-order-import-sale-advertising-drugs/note.html">Interim
				Order Respecting the Importation, Sale and Advertising of Drugs for Use in Relation to COVID-19</a>.</p>

		<h2 id="a2">How it works </h2>
		<p>mRNA vaccines teach our cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response without using the live
			virus that causes COVID-19. Once triggered, our body then makes antibodies. These antibodies protect us from being
			infected if the real virus does enter our body in the future.</p>
		<p>‘RNA’ stands for ribonucleic acid, which is a molecule that provides cells with instructions for making proteins.
			<a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/type-mrna.html">Messenger
				RNA (mRNA) vaccines</a> contain the genetic instructions for making the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. This protein
			is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
		<p>When a person is given the vaccine, their cells will read the genetic instructions like a recipe and produce the
			spike protein. After the protein piece is made, the cell breaks down the instructions and gets rid of them.</p>
		<p>The cell then displays the protein piece on its surface. Our immune system recognizes that the protein doesn’t
			belong there and begins building an immune response and making antibodies.</p>
		<h2 id="a3">How it’s given</h2>
		<p>The vaccine is given by an injection (0.3 mL) into the muscle of the arm. For the vaccine to work best, you need
			to get 2 doses: a single dose and then a second dose 21 days later.</p>
		<p>Based on studies in about 44,000 participants, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine was 95% effective in
			preventing SARS-CoV2 infection beginning 1 week after the second dose. This means that people may not be protected
			against COVID-19 disease until at least 7 days after the second dose.</p>
		<h2 id="a4">Possible side effects</h2>
		<p>In general, the side effects observed during the clinical trials are similar to what you might have with other
			vaccines.</p>
		<p>The side effects that followed vaccine administration in clinical trials were mild or moderate. They included
			things like pain at the site of injection, body chills, feeling tired and feeling feverish.</p>
		<p>These are common side effects of vaccines and do not pose a risk to health.</p>
		<p>As with all vaccines, there’s a chance that there will be a serious side effect, but these are rare. A serious
			side effect might be something like an allergic reaction.</p>
		<p>Health Canada has conducted a rigorous scientific review of the available medical evidence to assess the safety
			of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. No major safety concerns have been identified in the data that we
			reviewed.</p>
		<h2 id="a5">Vaccine safety after authorization</h2>
		<p>As for all medicines, Health Canada will continue to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/regulatory-response-health-product-access.html#a8">monitor
				the safety</a> of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in Canada closely. Along with the Public Health Agency of
			Canada and working in close collaboration with the provinces and territories and the manufacturer, we will monitor
			for any adverse events that may develop after immunization.</p>
		<p>Once the product is on the market, the manufacturer (Pfizer Canada ULC and BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH) is
			legally required to submit reports of adverse events to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>The manufacturer is planning to follow clinical trial participants for at least 2 years after the second dose of
			the vaccine is given. It must communicate any potential safety concerns to Health Canada.</p>
		<p>To ensure that the benefits of the vaccine continue to outweigh the risks, we may also impose terms and
			conditions at any time. For example, we can require the manufacturer to take further risk mitigation measures. We
			can also ask the manufacturer to submit additional safety information.</p>
		<p>Health Canada will continue to review all the available safety data as it becomes available. We will take
			appropriate action, if required, to protect the health and safety of Canadians.</p>
