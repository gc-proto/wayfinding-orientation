		<h2 id="a1">Clinical trials for vaccines</h2>


		<p><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/clinical-trials.html">Clinical trials</a> determine if COVID-19 vaccines are
			safe and effective.</p>


		<p>Vaccines are complex biological products. There are strict evidence requirements that need to be met before they
			can be authorized for use in healthy people. Large clinical trials are required to demonstrate a vaccine’s safety
			and effectiveness. </p>


		<p>There are more than 150 potential COVID-19 vaccines at different stages of development around the world. </p>


		<p>A number of vaccines are being developed in Canada. Healthy volunteers and COVID-19 patients in Canada may be
			able to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/list-authorized-trials.html">participate
				in clinical trials</a>. It isn’t necessary for clinical trials to be conducted in Canada for the vaccine to be
			authorized for use here.</p>


		<p>Generally, a vaccine development process involves a number of <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/clinical-trials.html#_Phases_of_clinical">clinical trial phases</a>.
			Researchers use the results from one phase to plan the next based on the evidence. </p>


		<p>For potential COVID-19 vaccines, manufacturers are using many processes to fast-track their development. This
			includes decreasing the time between trial phases by:</p>


		<ul>
			<li>using trial processes that test multiple vaccines at the same time </li>
			<li>running trials at the same time rather than doing them individually, which reduces the:
				<ul>
					<li>number of trials and steps needed</li>
					<li>time it takes to collect and assess the data
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>launching trials in areas affected the most by the pandemic (highest number of cases and severe illness) </li>
			<li>increasing collaboration with research networks, manufacturers and other partners here in Canada and around
				the world</li>
		</ul>




		<p>With these processes, manufacturers are able to speed up development without compromising safety and
			effectiveness (how well it works).</p>


		<h2 id="a2">Clinical trials for treatments</h2>




		<p>Clinical trials for treatments include testing: </p>


		<ul>
			<li>new drugs</li>
			<li>existing drugs that are already used for treating other medical conditions but may be effective for treating
				COVID-19</li>
		</ul>




		<p>These clinical trials follow the same phases as vaccine trials. </p>


		<p>There are <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/about.html#a3">many
				types of treatments</a> that are being reviewed in Canada and around the world. Learn about <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/list-authorized-trials.html">clinical
				trials for COVID-19 treatments</a>.</p>


		<h2 id="a3">Applying to conduct a clinical trial</h2>






		<p>Companies, academic research centres and physicians (known as sponsors) can <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/conducting-clinical-trial.html">apply
				to conduct a clinical trial</a>. An application can be made under either of the following:</p>


		<ul>
			<li>the <a
					href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/interim-order-respecting-clinical-trials-medical-devices-drugs.html">new
					COVID-19 interim order for clinical trials</a>
				<ul>
					<li>this process was set up to respond to the urgent need for research and development of COVID-19 drugs
						during the pandemic</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/c.r.c.,_c._870/page-133.html#h-577812"><em>Food
						and Drug Regulations</em></a></li>
		</ul>




		<p>We review applications to make sure the:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>vaccine used in the clinical trial doesn’t endanger the health of people taking part in the trial</li>
			<li>trial’s scientific goals can be met </li>
		</ul>
		<p>If all requirements are met, we’ll <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/list-authorized-trials.html">authorize
				the clinical trial</a>. </p>
