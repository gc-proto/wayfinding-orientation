		<h2 id="a1">Vaccine safety after authorization (pharmacovigilance)</h2>


		<p>Once a vaccine has been authorized for use in Canada, we then monitor its safety and effectiveness (how well it
			works) in people. This monitoring system is called post-market surveillance.</p>
		<p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re increasing:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>our monitoring and assessment activities of emerging safety issues</li>
			<li>collaboration and information-sharing with our partners here in Canada and around the world, such as the World
				Health Organization</li>
		</ul>




		<p>Companies are also required to continuously monitor the use of their health products and <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada/adverse-reaction-reporting/vaccine/industry.html">report
				any side effects to Health Canada</a>. This includes notifying us of potential safety concerns that weren’t
			observed during clinical trials. A company may also be:</p>


		<ul>
			<li>asked to perform other risk monitoring activities or post-market studies (beyond existing routine collection
				and assessment requirements) </li>
			<li>encouraged to fast-track reporting of possible side effects associated with COVID-19 vaccines </li>
		</ul>




		<p>Health Canada also monitors other sources of information, including actions taken for safety reasons by
			international regulatory agencies. Our goal is to quickly: </p>


		<ul>
			<li>respond to new information </li>
			<li>communicate risks to health care professionals and the public</li>
		</ul>




		<p>Learn more about <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/vaccination-children/safety-concerns-side-effects.html">vaccine safety,
				concerns and possible side effects</a>.</p>


		<h2 id="a2">Reporting safety concerns for vaccines</h2>




		<p>Anyone who witnesses or experiences a side effect to a vaccine is strongly encouraged to report it to their
			health care provider. </p>


		<p>Health care providers are required to <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/immunization/canadian-adverse-events-following-immunization-surveillance-system-caefiss.html#_Reporting_adverse_events">report
				adverse events following immunization</a> to their local public health authority. The public health authority
			then reports them to the Public Health Agency of Canada. </p>


		<h2 id="a3">Treatment safety and reporting safety concerns for drugs</h2>




		<p>Health Canada also has a strong monitoring system for drug safety.</p>


		<p>Anyone who witnesses or experiences a <a
				href="https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/medeffect-canada/adverse-reaction-reporting/drug.html">side
				effect to a drug is strongly encouraged to report it</a>. You can also work with your health care provider to
			submit a report. They may offer additional information that could be useful for our assessment.</p>
