			<h2 id="consult">Before getting your vaccine</h2>
	<h3>When to consult your doctor</h3>
		<p>For some people, the decision to get vaccinated will require consideration of  risks versus benefits. </p>

		<p>You should consult your doctor or a health professional if you:  </p>

		<ul>
		<li>are immunocompromised due to a disease or treatment, such as chemotherapy</li>
	  <li>have an autoimmune condition</li>
		<li>are pregnant or breastfeeding</li>
		</ul>

			<h2 id="vaccines">What vaccine will you get</h2>


	<!--	<p>Everyone who lives in Canada will have access to a safe, effective and free COVID-19 vaccine in 2021. </p>-->

			<p>There are currently no vaccine safety issues reported following COVID-19 vaccination.</p>

			<p>Each vaccine developed for COVID-19 may have different ingredients. </p>

		<p>Some vaccines require 2 doses to activate the body’s immune system, so that it can recognize and respond to future infections of COVID-19. Your health care provider will choose the vaccine that’s most appropriate for your individual situation, based on:

<ul>
	<li>age</li>
<li>underlying health conditions</li>
<li>other factors</li>
</ul>

			<p>Choose a vaccine below for more information on ingredients, allergies, side effects, how they work and how they’re administered: </p>

	        <h2 id="effects">Common side effects and reactions</h2>

		<p>After getting vaccinated, it's common to have <strong>temporary</strong> side effects. These can last a few hours to a few weeks after vaccination.</p>

		<p>Common vaccine side effects may include:</p>

	      <ul>
					<li>mild fever</li>
	  	<li>flu-like symptoms, such as:
	    		<ul>
		      	<li>chills</li>
	     		 <li>fatigue</li>
					 <li>joint pain</li>
						<li>headache</li>
						<li>muscle aches</li>
	    	</ul>
	  	</li>
	  	<li>redness, soreness or swelling in the arm or leg where the vaccine was given</li>
		</ul>

		<p>You can take medicine to help with any pain or to lower a fever. Ask your health care provider what they recommend.</p>

	<p>Other rare reactions that could occur after a vaccine include:</p>
			<ul>
  			<li>a fever above 40°C (104°F)</li>
  			<li>swelling and an itchy rash where the vaccine was given</li>
				<li>an allergic (anaphylactic) reaction</li>
	</ul>

		<h3 id="reporting">If you have an allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine</h3>

		<p>If you witness or experience a reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine, <strong>report it to your health care provider</strong>. They're required to report it to their local public health authority. The public health authority then reports them to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

		<p>If there is a safety issue with COVID-19 vaccines, Health Canada will take appropriate action. </p>

		<p>Health Canada and the Public Health Agency of Canada share the responsibility for ongoing monitoring. Learn more about how Canada makes sure vaccines are safe:</p>

		<h2 id="after">After getting vaccinated</h2>


			<p>Until a large number of people across Canada are vaccinated, public health measures are still needed to protect everyone and minimize the spread of COVID-19.</p>

			<p>At the moment, getting vaccinated doesn’t affect travel restrictions and quarantine requirements. </p>
