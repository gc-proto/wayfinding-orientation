            <h3>Changes to lockdown support</h3>
            <p><strong>May xx, 2021</strong></p>
            <p>The CRA has made changes to the CERS online calculator regarding the calculation of lockdown support.</p>
            <p>If a lockdown period is one week or longer, you may qualify for lockdown support even if the minimum lockdown period of one week overlaps two different claim periods.</p>
             <p>If you used the CERS calculator on or before May xx, 2021, it may not have accurately calculated your lockdown support if your lockdown period overlapped two or more claim periods.</p>

            <h2 id="h-1">How the subsidy is calculated</h2>
            <p>The CERS provides both a base subsidy and in some cases, a lockdown support amount.</p>
            <details>
        <summary>How much you may claim</summary>
        <p>The base subsidy rate applies to a maximum of $75,000 in eligible expenses per location and an overall maximum of $300,000 in expenses for you and any affiliated entities per claim period.</p>
        <p>If you must close or cease certain activities at one or more of your locations under a public health order for one week or longer, you may be eligible for lockdown support of 25% of eligible expenses per affected location for the days the order was in place.</p>
      </details>
            <details>
        <summary>Calculating your base rent subsidy rate</summary>
        <p>The amount you can claim of your expenses (your rent subsidy rate) is based on the <strong>revenue drop you experienced</strong> between</p>
        <ul class="lst-lwr-alph">
                <li><strong>Corresponding month of the previous year method:</strong> the months of 2019 and 2020 that relate to the claim period you're applying for</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative method: </strong>January and February 2020 compared to the months of 2020 that relate to the claim period</li>
              </ul>
        <p>This revenue drop is then scaled to calculate your rent subsidy rate:</p>

                <summary>Example: Gloria's Gift Shop</summary>
                <p>Gloria owns a gift shop in Ontario.</p>
                <p>Her location was closed due to a COVID-19 related public health order from May 5, 2021 to May 12, 2021 inclusive.</p>
                <p>Claim period 8 ended on May 8, 2021.</p>
                <p>This means she was locked down for 8 days total, but:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li>3 days occurred in claim period 8</li>
                        <li>5 days occurred in claim period 9</li>
                      </ul>
                <p>If Gloria used the CERS calculator to calculate the lockdown support when she applied for the rent subsidy for claim period 8 on May 9, 2021, she would not have received any lockdown support in her original claim.</p>
                <p>However, if Gloria re-applies for the rent subsidy after May xx, 2021, she may receive a lockdown support payment in claim periods 8 and 9. She would be eligible based on the 3 days her business was closed at the end of the claim period 8 and the 5 days it was closed at the beginning of period 9.</p>
              </ul>
                  </li>
          </ul>
                <div class="provisional alert alert-info">
            <p>If you used the CERS calculator on or before May xx, 2021, it may not have accurately calculated your lockdown support if your lockdown period overlapped two or more claim periods.</p>

                <p>A public health order must:</p>
                <ul>
            <li>be issued by a federal, provincial, or municipal government, or a local health authority</li>
            <li>be limited based on at least one of these factors:
                    <ul>
                <li>geographical boundaries</li>
                <li>type of business or other activity</li>

            <li>result in sanctions or be an offence if you do not comply</li>
            <li>require you to stop some or all of your regular activities while the order is in place
                    <ul>
                <li>activities you were not able to carry out must account for at least approximately 25% of total revenues at that location during the prior reference period</li>

          </ul>
                <p>An order that restricts or reduces activities but doesn’t require you to close or stop certain activities does not qualify for lockdown support. </p>
                <p><strong>Examples of restrictions that do not qualify for lockdown support</strong></p>
                <ul>
            <li>travel restrictions that reduce the number of clients</li>

              </ul>
                  </li>
            <li>any other restrictions that do not specifically order you to stop or close an activity, such as
