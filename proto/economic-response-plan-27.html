Typically, the agreement indicates that you and your lender have agreed to pause or suspend your mortgage payments for a certain amount of time.  After the agreement ends, your mortgage payments return to normal and the deferred payments — including principal and accumulated interest – are added to the outstanding principal balance and subsequently repaid throughout the life of the mortgage.</p>
	                  <p>To know if you are eligible for a mortgage payment deferral or to learn what options are available, contact your lender — your bank or your mortgage professional.</p>
