Thanks to a $910,000  investment from WD, the Cowessess First Nation in Saskatchewan has achieved a  first in Canada.

Not only does this project generate clean energy, it is also creating new  economic opportunities. It supports 12 small to medium-sized enterprises,  including 3 Indigenous businesses.</p>
