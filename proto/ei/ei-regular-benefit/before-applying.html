				<h2>Changes to support you during COVID-19</h2>
				<p>As of September 27, 2020, there are some temporary changes to the EI program to help you access EI regular
					benefits. The following changes will be in effect for 1 year and could apply to you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A minimum unemployment rate of 13.1% applies to all regions across Canada starting August 9, 2020 <ul>
							<li>If your region’s unemployment rate is higher than 13.1%, we’ll use the higher actual rate to calculate your
								benefits</li>
							<li>This means you can receive at least 26 weeks of regular benefits</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>You only need 120 insured hours to qualify for benefits because you’ll get a one-time credit of 300 insured
						hours to help you meet the required 420 insured hours of work</li>
					<li>You’ll receive at least $500 per week before taxes but you could receive more</li>
					<li>If you received the CERB, the 52-week period to accumulate insured hours will be extended</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Sections on this page impacted by these temporary changes are flagged as <span class="label label-info"><span
							class="h3 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">Temporary COVID-19 relief</span></span>.</p>

							id="fn1-ref"> <a href="#fn1" class="fn-lnk"> <span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a> </sup> in the last 52
						weeks or since the start of your last <abbr>EI</abbr> claim, whichever is the shorter period. This information
						will be used, along with your Record(s) of Employment, to calculate your benefit rate. <a href="#covid19-changes"
							class="label label-info"><span class="h3 mrgn-tp-0 mrgn-bttm-0">Temporary COVID-19 relief</span></a></li>
				</ul>
				<p>You may also have to provide the following details if you are reactivating an existing claim:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>the salary amount you received, before deductions, for the last week you worked (from Sunday to your last day of
						work), including insurable tips and commissions</li>

						lieu of notice, and other money)</li>
				</ul>
				<p>When you apply for <abbr>EI</abbr> benefits, be sure to <strong>sign up for <a
							href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/programs/direct-deposit.html">direct deposit</a></strong> to get your
					payments as quickly as possible. When you use direct deposit, your <abbr>EI</abbr> payments are deposited
					automatically into your bank account two business days after we process your <a
