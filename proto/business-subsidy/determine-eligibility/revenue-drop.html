<p>To qualify for and find the amount of your subsidy, you will need to calculate your revenue drop for each claim period.</p>
<p>For periods 22 and later, you also need to know your 12-month average revenue drop. This is a one-time calculation.</p>

<h2 id="eligible-revenue">What eligible revenue is</h2>
	<div id="eligible-revenue-cntnt">
        	<p>Eligible revenue generally includes revenue earned in Canada from:</p>
                        <ul>
                           <li>selling goods</li>
                           <li>rendering services, and</li>

                        </ul>
                <p>Generally, you should use your normal accounting method when calculating your eligible revenue. If your normal accounting method is the accrual method, you can <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q12">elect to use the cash method</a> (and vice versa), but once you choose you must use the same accounting method for all your claims.</p>
                <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to use the cash method, you need to check the “cash method” election box when completing your application.</p>

<h2 id="claim-rev-drop">How the claim period revenue drop is calculated</h2>
	<p>You can <a href=""><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> use the online calculator or spreadsheet to calculate your claim period revenue drop</a>.</p>
	<p>Or, read the details of how the claim period revenue drop is calculated.</p>
	<details><summary>How the claim period revenue drop is calculated</summary>
		<p>Your claim period revenue drop is the decline in eligible revenue you experienced when comparing your claim period revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
   		<p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 – (Claim period revenue / prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
   		
		<h3 id="deeming">Using the current or prior claim period revenue drop (the “deeming rule”)</h3>
		<p>For all wage and subsidy applications as of July 5, 2020, you calculate two revenue drops and use the higher result in your base rate calculation. If you use the <a href="">online calculator or spreadsheet</a> to calculate your subsidy amount, both rates will be calculated when you enter your revenues and the higher rate will automatically be applied.</p>

   <p>You must choose one of these prior reference period options and use the same approach when calculating your revenue drop (including any top-up calculations) for all wage and rent subsidy claims that cover July 5, 2020, and later. However:</p>
   <ul>
	<li>if you were not operating on March 1, 2019, you may elect to use the alternative approach for CEWS claims for periods 14 to 17 and CERS claims for periods 7 to 10, even if you used the general approach for prior claims</li>
	 </ul>
   <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you choose to use the alternative prior reference period (January and February 2020), you need to check the "prior reference period" election box when completing your subsidy application form.</p>

<h2 id="12-rev-drop">How the 12-month average revenue drop is calculated</h2>
	<p>You only need to calculate the 12-month average revenue drop <strong>one time</strong>. You will use the same 12-month average revenue drop for all of your claims from 22 onward.</p>
  	<p>Your 12-month average revenue drop is the average of your revenue drops for each of the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic (March 2020 to February 2021).</p>
	<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you applied for CEWS periods 1 to 13 or CERS periods 1 to 6, you have already calculated some of the monthly revenue drops you need to find this average.</p>	
	<p>You can <a href=""><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> use the calculator to find your 12-month revenue drop</a>.</p>
	<p>Or, read the details of how the 12-month average revenue drop is calculated.</p>

	<p>To calculate your revenue drop each month, compare that month's revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
   	<p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) &equals; 1 &minus; (calculation month revenue &divide; prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>

		<p>This is your revenue drop for one month.</p>
			<p><strong>Important</strong>: if any of the months you calculate had a revenue <strong>increase</strong> instead of a drop, you must still include those months in your average.</p>
			

   <h3 id="#">Prior reference period options</h3>

	<p>Like the calculation for the claim period revenue drop, the same two prior reference period comparison options can be used when calculating your 12-month average, the general approach or the alternative approach.</p>

   		<h3>Examples of a 12-month revenue drop calculation</h3>
		<details>
			<summary>Example: Calculating a 12-month average revenue drop as a seasonal business</summary>
			<p>Teshia's food truck is normally open from March to October, and does not operate in the winter.</p>
			<p>To calculate the 12-month revenue drop, Teshia will:</p>
			<ol class="lst-stps">
				<li>Total the number of months from March 2020 to February 2021 in which they were operating: <strong>8</strong></li>
				<li>Determine the revenue drop for each of the remaining months:
					<ul>
						<li>March 2020 over March 2019: <strong>95.05%</strong></li>
						<li>April 2020 over April 2019: <strong>78.33%</strong></li>
						<li>May 2020 over May 2019: <strong>60.15%</strong></li>
						<li>June 2020 over June 2019: <strong>51.08%</strong></li>
						<li>July 2020 over July 2019: <strong>-5.05%</strong> (increase)</li>
						<li>August 2020 over August 2019: <strong>42.22%</strong></li>
						<li>September 2020 over September 2019: <strong>48.83%</strong></li>
						<li>October 2020 over October 2019: <strong>61.08%</strong></li>
					</ul>
					Teshia chooses the general approach to calculate the revenue drops because they were not operating in January and February of 2020.</li>
				<li>Add the drops together: 431.69%</li>
				<li>Divide by the number of operational months (8): <strong>53.96%</strong></li>
				</ul>
			<p>Teshia's resulting 12-month average revenue drop is 53.96%, which is high enough to meet the 12-month average revenue drop requirement for the THRP or the HHBRP. Teshia can use this result on any subsidy claims they make from period 22 onward, if they meet the other eligibility criteria for that claim period.</p>
		</details>
		 <details>
			<summary>Example: Calculating a 12-month average revenue drop when you've claimed a subsidy in the past</summary>
			<p>Subramaniam's travel agency opened in June 2019. He applied for the CERS as soon as it became available after September 27, 2020.</p>
			<p>Because he has applied for CERS in the past, he has already calculated revenue drops for September 2020 to February 2021.</p>
			<p>Subramaniam chose the general approach when calculating his CERS revenue drops, so he must use the general approach when calculating his revenue drops for the 12-month average from July 2020 onward. However, because he did not apply for any subsidy from March 2020 to June 2020, and you could switch approaches in July 2020, he may choose to calculate the first 4 months with either approach, whichever is to his benefit.</p>
				 
			<p>To calculate the 12-month revenue drop, Subramaniam will:</p>

					<li>Calculate his revenue drops for March to June, 2020, and choose either the general or alternative approach:

				Although the general approach gives him a better rate when calculating June 2020, Subramaniam chooses the alternative approach to calculate the revenue drops from March to June 2020 because it gives a better rate over the four months.</li>
				<li>Calculate his revenue drops using the general approach for July and August 2020:
					<ul>
						<li>1 &minus; (July 2020 eligible revenue: $15,000 &divide; July 2019: $27,000): <strong>44.44%</strong></li>
						<li>1 &minus; (August 2020 eligible revenue: $14,500 &divide; August 2019: $23,000): <strong>36.96%</strong></li>
					</ul></li>
				 <li>Find his calculated revenue drops for the remaining months:
					<ul>
						<li>September 2020: <strong>34.00%</strong></li>
						<li>October 2020: <strong>22.83%</strong></li>
						<li>November 2020: <strong>61.15%</strong></li>
						<li>December 2020: <strong>47.07%</strong></li>
						<li>January 2021: <strong>34.83%</strong></li>
						<li>February 2021: <strong>35.33%</strong></li>
					</ul>
					 <strong>Important:</strong> Subramaniam did not always use the revenue drops from his final CERS claims, because he could choose the higher of two rates for each claim. For example, he used his November 2020 revenue drop on his CERS claims for periods 2, 3, and 4 (because of the deeming rule and the repeat of months used to calculate CERS periods 3 and 4). There is no comparison of monthly rates when calculating the 12-month average. Each month your businesses was operating must be calculated and included.</li>
				<li>Add the 12 drops together: 493.27%</li>
				<li>Divide by 12: <strong>41.11%</strong></li>
				</ul>
			<p>Subramaniam's resulting 12-month average revenue drop is 41.11%, which is high enough to meet the 12-month average revenue drop requirement for the THRP but disqualifies him from applying for the HHBRP. He can use this result for any THRP subsidy claims he makes from period 22 onward, if he meets the other eligibility requirements for that claim period.</p>
