		<p>We will be reviewing claims to confirm the information you submit.</p>
		<h2 id="h-3">Keep your records</h2>
		<p>You must keep records showing information that supports your claim, such as your reduction in revenue and amounts paid to employees.</p>
		<p>Read more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q33">records you should keep</a>, for any wage or rent subsidy you claim, in the CEWS technical questions and answers.</p>
	  <h2 id="#h-4">Notice of determination</h2>
	  <p>After you apply, we will let you know in a notice of determination if your claim was accepted.</p>
<!--<p>If you are receiving an amount for the Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP), we will automatically determine your other wage subsidy for the same period to be $0, even if you entered an amount at line 300 on your CRHP application (amount calculated for the wage subsidy) that was higher than $0. In this situation, your wage subsidy amount is deemed to be $0 because you are only entitled to the hiring or wage subsidy that gives you the higher amount.</p>
<details><summary>More information about why we mention CEWS, HHBRP, or THRP on your CRHP notice</summary>
<p>According to the legislation, one of the qualifications for the CRHP is that you must also submit an application for the wage subsidy for that claim period. To keep the process simpler for you, we consider this condition to be met when you enter your other wage subsidy amount at line 300 in your CRHP application. If you apply for the CRHP, you do not need to complete and submit separate application forms for the other wage subsidies.</p></details>-->
	  
	  <h2 id="h-1">Calls and letters from the CRA</h2>
		<p>The CRA may need to contact you by phone or mail to confirm details, ask for more information about your application, or notify you that your claim was not approved. Please <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/changes-your-business/change-address.html">make sure your contact information is current</a>. </p>
		<h3>Calls from the CRA</h3>
		<p>CRA phone agents will never:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>use threatening or coercive language</li>
			<li>ask for full banking information, or </li>
			<li>ask for your full Social Insurance Number (SIN) </li>
		</ul>
		<p>CRA phone agents should be able to provide you with information about your subsidy application, as well as their name and phone number. </p>
		<details>
			<summary>If you have concerns about a call you received from the CRA</summary>
			<p>If you have concerns about a call you received regarding your subsidy application, please <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-contact.html#phone">call the Business Enquiries line</a> to verify the name and number of the person that called you. </p>
			<p>You can also read more about <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/corporate/security/protect-yourself-against-fraud.html">how to recognize scams</a>.</p>
		</details>
		<h3>Letters from the CRA</h3>
		<p>You may receive a letter from the CRA if your subsidy application was not accepted, or if your claim was modified after we review the information.</p>
		
	  <h2 id="h-2">Consequences of fraudulent claims</h2>
		<p>If you do not meet the eligibility requirements for a period, you will be required to repay any subsidy amounts you received for that period. Canadians can also report suspected misuse through the CRA’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/suspected-tax-cheating-in-canada-overview.html">Leads program</a>.</p>
		<p>Penalties may apply in cases of fraudulent claims, including fines or even imprisonment.</p>
		<p>If you artificially reduce your revenue for the purpose of claiming subsidies through the Canada Emergencey Wage Subsidy, the Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program, or the Hardest-Hit Businesses Subsidy Program, you will be required to repay any subsidy amounts you received, plus a penalty equal to 25% of the total value.</p>
	  <p>Additionally, if you, or a person or partnership with which you deal at non-arm’s-length, enter into a transaction or participate in an event (or a series of transactions or events) or take an action (or fail to take an action) that has the effect of increasing your incremental remuneration, and one of the main purposes of the action is to increase your CRHP amount, you will be required to repay any amounts you received, plus a penalty equal to 25% of the total value.</p>
