	<h2 id="h-1">Who the executive compensation repayment applies to</h2>
    
	  	<p>You may need to repay wage subsidy amounts you received for claim periods after June 5, 2021, if all three of these things apply:
		<ul>
			<li>you are a <strong>public corporation</strong> (an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed or traded on a stock exchange or other public market), or you have a <strong>public parent corporation</strong> (a public corporation that controls you)</li> 
			<li>your compensation for specified executives during either 2021 or 2022 (calendar year) exceeds your compensation for those specified executives during the 2019 calendar year</li>
			<li>you received wage subsidy amounts for active eligible employees for claim periods 17 or later</li>
	  	</ul>
		</p>
	  
	  <h2 id="h-2">What is executive compensation</h2>
	  	  <p>For the purposes of calculating the executive compensation repayment, executive compensation is determined according to the laws under which you are required to make disclosures to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>If you are required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws</strong>, your executive compensation is the total amount of compensation that is required to be disclosed in the Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers. This is the amount reported on form 51-102F6, pursuant to the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations. 
Generally, this amount is the total compensation reported for the:
	<ul>
			  <li>Chief Executive Officer</li>
			  <li>Chief Financial Officer, and</li>
			  <li>three other most highly compensated executives</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>If you are required to make a similar disclosure to shareholders under the laws of another jurisdiction</strong> (but are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws), your executive compensation is the amount of total compensation reported in that similar disclosure (limited to the five most highly compensated individuals).</p>
<p><strong>If you are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under any jurisdiction</strong>, your executive compensation is the amount that you would be required to be report if you were required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws (i.e. using the method for preparing form 51-102F6).</p>
    <h3>Calculating executive compensation for a calendar year</h3>
	  	  <p>The amount of executive compensation is determined with respect to the calendar year. If your fiscal period does not coincide with the calendar year, you must prorate the fiscal periods that overlap the calendar year according to the number of days in the fiscal period that fall within the calendar year.</p>
    <h2 id="h-3">Calculating your repayment amount</h2>
	  	  <p>The executive compensation repayment calculation is different for the two executive compensation repayment time periods:
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Your executive compensation repayment amount will not exceed the amount of wage subsidy you received.</p>
<p>If you are part of a group of employers, your repayment is calculated according to the percentage assigned to you under an agreement.

</p>-->

</p>
    <h2 id="h-4">Determining your repayment as part of a group of eligible employers</h2>
	  	  <p>If you are part of a group of eligible employers calculating an executive compensation repayment amount, you must complete an agreement (form RC224) to determine each employer’s share of the repayment.
<p>An agreement is required if the group of eligible employers received wage subsidy amounts for one or both of the following time periods:
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For this purpose, the group of eligible employers includes:
	<ul>
		<li>the eligible employer</li>
		<li>the public parent corporation, and</li> 
<li>each other eligible employer controlled in that claim period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation to the extent that they have received a wage subsidy amount for the relevant time period</li>
</ul>
	<p>An agreement allows the members of the group to determine how much of the total executive compensation repayment amount for the relevant time period will be repaid by each of them. Each member of the group must enter into the agreement for the relevant time period, filed in a prescribed form.
<p><strong>Related form:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/rc224/rc224-22e.pdf">Executive Compensation Repayment Amount Agreement (RC224)</a></p>

    <h3>Assigning percentages under an agreement</h3>
	  	  <p>The agreement must assign a percentage (including 0%) to each member of the group. The percentages assigned to group members under the agreement must total 100%.
When assigning percentages, <strong>no member of the group can be assigned a percentage that would create a greater repayment obligation than the total of its wage subsidy amounts for the relevant time period</strong>. Accordingly, where no agreement is made (for example, where there is only one corporation in the group that received the wage subsidy), the default percentage is 100%. 
The percentage applicable to each member of the group may be different for each executive compensation repayment time period.
</p>
    <h2 id="h-5">How to repay excess subsidy amounts you received</h2>
	  	  <p>If you have an executive compensation repayment amount, you have received more wage subsidy than you were entitled to. </p>
<p>An amount of wage subsidy you claimed that you were not entitled to is called an <strong>excess refund</strong> of wage subsidy.</p>
<p>If you have an excess refund of wage subsidy, you must <a href="change or cancel your claim">adjust your wage subsidy claims</a> for the relevant claim periods to remove the amount of excess subsidy at line C.</p>

<p>The specific claim adjustments are determined separately for the two executive compensation repayment time periods:</p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
											       <p>Within each time period, you must repay <strong>later</strong> wage subsidy amounts first, until the total of your executive compensation repayment amount has been subtracted from your wage subsidy claims.</p>
<p>An excess refund is deemed to have become payable to the Receiver General on the date it was paid to you.</p>
<h3>Calculating excess wage subsidy refunds for claim periods 17 to 23</h3>

<p>You must calculate your excess refund for each wage subsidy payment you received for claim periods 17 through 23. The excess refund is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
	  <p>The amount of wage subsidy received on a particular date</p></li>
		<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The amount determined by the formula <strong>A &minus; B</strong> where:
	<ul><li><strong>A</strong> is the eligible employer’s compensation repayment amount for claim periods 17 to 23 </li>
		<li><strong>B</strong> is the total of all excess refunds determined after the date of that wage subsidy payment</li>
			</ul></p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Calculating excess wage subsidy refunds for claim periods 24 and later</h3>

<p>You must calculate your excess refund for each wage subsidy payment you received for claim periods 24 and later. The excess refund is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:
		<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
	  <p>The amount of wage subsidy received on a particular date</p></li>
		<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The amount determined by the formula <strong>A &minus; B</strong> where:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A</strong> is the <strong>greater</strong> of:
			<ul>
				<li>the eligible employer’s executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 and subsequent claim periods, and</li>
				<li>where the eligible employer is a publicly traded company or a subsidiary of such a company, the amount of taxable dividends paid by the company or its subsidiary to an individual who is a holder of common shares of the company or of the subsidiary of the company</li>
			</ul></li>
			<li><strong>B</strong> the total of all excess refunds determined after the date of that wage subsidy payment</li>
			</ul></p></li>

	<summary>Example 1: Period 17 to 23 calculation when the subsidy received is the lesser amount</summary>

<p>ABC Corporation is an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed on the Toronto
Stock Exchange. It does not control&mdash;nor is it controlled by&mdash;any other public
parent corporation.</p>

<p>ABC Corporation’s fiscal period for Canadian tax and securities law purposes coincides with the
calendar year. In 2019, the total amount of compensation that it was required
to disclose in its Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive
Officers (i.e. form 51-102F6) was $4,500,000. In 2021, the total amount of
compensation that it was required to disclose in form 51-102F6 was $8,000,000.</p>

<p>During claim periods 17 to&nbsp;21, for which ABC Corporation claimed the wage subsidy, it
had no eligible employees on leave with pay. Below are the wage subsidy amounts
ABC Corporation was refunded in respect of those claim periods and the dates on
which those amounts were refunded. ABC Corporation did not claim a wage subsidy
for claim periods 22 and 23.</p>

<p>ABC Corporation’s executive compensation repayment amount is $3,500,000, which is the lesser of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount refunded for claim periods&nbsp;17 to
     21 (i.e. $1,250,000 + $1,050,000 + $950,000 + $750,000 $250,000 = $4,250,000),
     and</li>
 <li>the amount by which its 2021 executive compensation exceeded its 2019 executive compensation (i.e.
     $8,000,000 - $4,500,000 = $3,500,000)</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the executive compensation wage subsidy repayment rule, the wage subsidy amounts refunded to ABC
Corporation will be reduced by its executive compensation repayment amount, with the later wage subsidy amounts refunded being reduced first.</p>

wage subsidy amount (i.e. $4,750,000 = $5,500,000 - $750,000). This excess
refund amount of $850,000 is deemed to have become payable to the Receiver
General by XYZ Corporation on April 13, 2022.</li>

than the executive compensation repayment amount that has not yet reduced a
wage subsidy amount (i.e. $3,900,000 = $5,500,000 - $750,000 - $850,000). This
excess refund amount of $1,050,000 is deemed to have become payable to the
Receiver General by XYZ Corporation on August&nbsp;5, 2021.</li>

      <li class="lst-item">The entirety of XYZ Corporation’s wage subsidy amount refunded on February 16, 2022, is reduced
because the wage subsidy amount refunded on that date (i.e. $1,300,000) is less
than the executive compensation repayment amount that has not yet reduced a
wage subsidy amount (i.e. $2,800,000 = $5,500,000 - $750,000 - $850,000 - $1,100,000).
This excess refund amount of $1,300,000 is deemed to have become payable to the Receiver General by XYZ Corporation on February 16, 2022.</li>

      <li class="lst-item">XYZ Corporation’s wage subsidy amount refunded on February 16, 2022, is reduced by $1,500,000,
which is the lesser of the wage subsidy amount refunded on that date (i.e. $1,800,000)
and the executive compensation repayment amount that has not yet reduced a wage
subsidy amount (i.e. $1,500,000 = $5,500,000 - $750,000 - $850,000 - $1,100,000
- $1,800,000). This excess refund amount of $1,500,000 is deemed to have become
