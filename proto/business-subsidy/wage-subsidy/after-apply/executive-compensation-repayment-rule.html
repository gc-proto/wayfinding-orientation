	<h2 id="h-1">Who the executive compensation repayment rule applies to</h2>
    
	  	<p>You may need to repay wage subsidy amounts you received for claim periods after June 5, 2021, if all three of these things apply:
		<ul>
			<li>you are a public corporation (you are an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed or traded on a stock exchange or other public market), or you have a public parent corporation (a corporation that controls you is a public corporation)</li> 
			<li>your compensation for specified executives during 2021 or 2022 (either or both calendar years) exceeds your compensation for those specified executives during the 2019 calendar year</li>
			<li>you received wage subsidy amounts for active eligible employees for claim periods 17 or later</li>
	  	</ul>
		</p>
	  
	  <h2 id="h-2">What is executive compensation</h2>
	  	  <p>For the purposes of calculating the executive compensation repayment, executive compensation is determined for a calendar year, according to the laws under which you are required to make disclosures to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>If you are required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws</strong></p>
<p>Your executive compensation is the total amount of compensation that is required to be disclosed in the Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers. This is the amount reported on form 51-102F6, pursuant to the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations. 
Generally, this amount is the total compensation reported for the:
	<ul>
			  <li>Chief Executive Officer</li>
			  <li>Chief Financial Officer, and</li>
			  <li>three other most highly compensated executives</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>If you are required to make a similar disclosure to shareholders under the laws of another jurisdiction</strong> (but are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws)</p>
<p>Your executive compensation is the amount of total compensation reported in that similar disclosure (limited to the five most highly compensated individuals).</p>
<p><strong>If you are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under any jurisdiction</strong></p>
<p>Your executive compensation is the amount that you would be required to be report if you were required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws (i.e. using the method for preparing form 51-102F6).</p>
    <h3>Calculating executive compensation for a calendar year</h3>
	  	  <p>The amount of executive remuneration is determined with respect to the calendar year. If your fiscal period does not coincide with the calendar year, you must prorate the fiscal periods that overlap the calendar year according to the number of days in the fiscal period that fall within the calendar year.</p>
    <h2 id="h-3">Calculating your executive compensation repayment</h2>
	  	  <p>The executive compensation repayment calculation is different for the two executive compensation repayment time periods:
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Generally, the repayment amount is the lesser of: 
	<ul>
		<li>the amount of wage subsidy you received for a specific time period, or </li>
<li>the executive compensation paid for a specific calendar year that exceeds the amount paid for 2019</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If you are part of a group of employers, your repayment is also calculated according to the percentage assigned to you under an agreement.
</p>
    <h3>Executive compensation repayment calculation for claim periods 17 to 23</h3>
	  	  <p>For claim periods 17 to 23, the executive compensation repayment amount for an eligible employer is determined by the formula <strong>A &times; B</strong>, where:
<p><strong>A</strong> is:
<ul>
	<li>the percentage assigned to the eligible employer under an agreement, or</li>
	<li>in any other case, 100%</li>
</ul>
<strong>B</strong> is the lesser of:
<ul>
	<li>the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for claim periods 17 to 23 received in respect of the eligible employees of:
		<ul>
		<li>the eligible employer</li>
		<li>the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
		<li>each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant claim period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any</li>
		</ul>
		
		<strong>or</strong></li>
	<li>the amount, if any, by which the 2021 executive remuneration of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;exceeds such executive remuneration for 2019</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <h3>Executive compensation repayment calculation for claim periods 24 and later</h3>
	  	  <p>The calculation for claim periods 24 and later is similar to the calculation for periods 17 to 23. However, this calculation also includes excess executive compensation from the period 17 to 23 calculation. This excess is any executive compensation that was considered in the calculation of the executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 17 to 23 but was not set off against relevant wage subsidy amounts received for those claim periods.</p>
<p>For claim period 24 and subsequent claim periods, the executive compensation repayment amount for an eligible employer is determined by the formula <strong>A &times; B</strong>, where:

<p><strong>A</strong> is:
<ul>
	<li>the percentage assigned to the eligible employer under an agreement, or</li>
	<li>in any other case, 100%</li>
</ul>
<strong>B</strong> is the lesser of:
<ul>
	<li>the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for <strong>claim period 24 and subsequent claim periods</strong> received in respect of the active eligible employees of:
		<ul>
		<li>the eligible employer</li>
		<li>the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
		<li>each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant claim period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any</li>
		</ul>
		<strong>or</strong></li>
	<li>the total of <strong>C</strong> and <strong>D</strong>, where<br />
		<strong>C</strong> is:
<ul>
	<li>the amount, if any, by which the <strong>2021</strong> executive remuneration of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;exceeds such executive remuneration for 2019<br />
		<strong>minus</strong><br />
the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount:
		<ul>
			<li>of the eligible employer</li>
			<li>of the public parent corporation, if any</li>
<li>of each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant claim period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
			<li>for <strong>claim periods 17 to 23</strong> received in respect of its active eligible employees</li>
		</ul></li></ul>
		<strong>D</strong> is:
	<li>the amount, if any, by which the <strong>2022</strong> executive remuneration of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;exceeds such executive remuneration for 2019</li>
</ul>
