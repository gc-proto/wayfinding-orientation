		</ul>

    
	<h2 id="h-1">Who the repayment rule applies to</h2>
    
	  	<p>You may need to repay wage subsidy amounts you received for claim periods after June 5, 2021, (periods 17 and later) if:
		<ul>
			<li>you are a <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="public-co" href="#public-co">publicly <span class="nowrap">traded corporation<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> (an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed or traded on a stock exchange or other public market), or you have a public parent corporation (you are controlled by a publicly traded corporation)</li> 
			<li>you received wage subsidy amounts for active eligible employees for claim periods 17 or later</li>
    <li><strong>and</strong> either:
    <ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>Your compensation for specified executives during either the 2021 or 2022 calendar year exceeds your compensation for those executives during the 2019 calendar year<br />
      <a href="#h-2">Read about executive compensation</a></p>
  </li>
  <li class="cnjnctn-col">
    <p>You or your subsidiary paid taxable dividends in claim period 24 or later to a common share holder who is an individual<br />
      <a href="#h-2-1">Read about repayments due to taxable dividends</a></p>
	    </li>
	  </ul></li>
	  	</ul>
	  <h2 id="h-2">What executive compensation is</h2>
	  	  <p>For the purposes of calculating this repayment, executive compensation is determined according to the laws under which you or your public parent corporation are required to make disclosures to shareholders.</p>
<p><strong>If you or your public parent corporation are required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws</strong>, your executive compensation is the total amount of compensation that is required to be disclosed in the Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers, pursuant to the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations. 
Generally, this amount is the total compensation reported for the:
	<ul>
			  <li>Chief Executive Officer</li>
			  <li>Chief Financial Officer, and</li>
			  <li>three other most highly compensated executives</li>
</ul></p>
<p><strong>If you or your public parent corporation are required to make a similar disclosure to shareholders under the laws of another jurisdiction</strong> (but are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws), your executive compensation is the amount of total compensation reported in that similar disclosure (limited to the five most highly compensated individuals).</p>
<p><strong>If you or your public parent corporation are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under any jurisdiction</strong>, your executive compensation is the amount that you would report if you were required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws, using the method for preparing a Statement of Executive Compensation.</p>
    <h3>Calculating executive compensation for a calendar year</h3>
	  	  <p>The amount of executive compensation is determined by the calendar year. If your fiscal period does not coincide with the calendar year, you must prorate the fiscal periods that overlap the calendar year according to the number of days in the fiscal period that fall within the calendar year.</p>
    
		
		  <h2 id="h-2-1">Repayments due to taxable dividends</h2>
	
	<p>As a publicly traded corporation, there are two situations in which may need to return a wage subsidy you received because of <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="taxable-div" href="#taxable-div">taxable <span class="nowrap">dividends<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> you paid to an individual holder of <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="common-shares" href="#common-shares">common <span class="nowrap">shares<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a>:</p>

<ol class="lst-stps">
      <li class="lst-item">As of claim period 23, you are not entitled to a wage subsidy for a claim period in which you or your subsidiary paid these taxable dividends. If you received wage subsidy you were not entitled to for a particular claim period, find out how to <a href="return-payment.html">return a payment</a>.</li>
<li class="lst-item">If you or your subsidiary paid these taxable dividends any time in period 24 or later, you may need to repay some or all of the wage subsidy amounts you received for any of the other claim periods from 24 onward. If you are in this situation, calculate your repayment using the <a href="#h3-2">executive compensation repayment calculation for claim periods 24 and later</a>.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2 id="h-3">Calculating your repayment amount</h2>
	  	  <p>The executive compensation repayment calculation is different for the two executive compensation repayment time periods:
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>If you are part of a group of employers, your repayment is calculated according to the percentage assigned to you under an agreement.
</p>
	
    <h3>Executive compensation repayment calculation for claim periods 17 to 23</h3>
	
	  	  <p>For claim periods 17 to 23, the executive compensation repayment amount for an eligible employer is determined by the formula <strong>A &times; B</strong>, where:
<p><strong>A</strong> is:
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="#h-4">percentage assigned to the eligible employer under a group agreement</a>, or</li>
	<li>in any other case, 100%</li>
</ul>
	<strong>B</strong> is the <strong>lesser</strong> of <strong>C or D</strong>, where:
<ul>
	<li><strong>C</strong> is the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for claim periods 17 to 23 received in respect of active eligible employees of:
		<ul>
		<li>the eligible employer</li>
		<li>the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
		<li>each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant claim period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any</li>
		</ul></li><br />
	<li><strong>D</strong> is:
		<ul><li>the amount of executive compensation of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;for 2021</li>
			<li><strong>minus</strong> the amount of such executive compensation for 2019</li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">
	<h4 id="excess-1723">Carry-forward executive compensation repayment amount from periods 17 to 23</h4>
		<p>If the executive compensation from 2021 minus the amount from 2019 (amount <strong>D</strong>) is <strong>higher</strong> than the wage subsidy received (amount <strong>C</strong>) in the calculation above, you have a <strong>carry-forward executive compensation repayment amount</strong> for periods 17 to 23. You must include this carry-forward repayment amount when calculating your repayment for periods 24 and later. The carry-forward executive compensation repayment amount from periods 17 to 23 equals <strong>D minus C</strong>. </p>
	<p>If all of your executive compensation from 2021 minus the amount from 2019 is set off against the wage subsidy amounts you received for periods 17 to 23 (<strong>C</strong> is higher than <strong>D</strong>), you do not have a carry-forward executive compensation repayment amount to include in your calculation for periods 24 and later.</p>
	</section>
    <h3 id="h3-2">Executive compensation repayment calculation for claim periods 24 and later</h3>
	  	  <p>The calculation for claim periods 24 and later is similar to the calculation for periods 17 to 23. However, the calculation for claim periods 24 and later also includes any <strong>excess executive compensation repayment amount from the period 17 to 23 calculation</strong>. </p>
<p>For claim period 24 and subsequent claim periods, the executive compensation repayment amount for an eligible employer equals <strong>A &times; B</strong>, where:
<p><strong>A</strong> is:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="#h-4">percentage assigned to the eligible employer under a group agreement</a>, or</li>
	<li>in any other case, 100%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> is the <strong>lesser</strong> of <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>, where:</p>
<ul><li><strong>C</strong> is the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for claim period 24 and subsequent claim periods received in respect of active eligible employees of:
<ul>
<li>the eligible employer</li>
<li>the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
<li>each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant claim period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>D</strong> is the total, if it is greater than zero, of:
<ul>
	<li>any <a href="#excess-1723">carry-forward executive compensation repayment amount from periods 17 to 23</a></li>
	<li><strong>plus</strong> the amount of executive compensation of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;for 2022</li>
	<li><strong>minus</strong> the amount of such executive compensation for 2019</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>

</p>
    <h2 id="h-4">Determining your repayment as part of a group of eligible employers</h2>
	  	  <p>If you are part of a group of eligible employers calculating an executive compensation repayment amount, you may need to complete an agreement (form RC224) to determine each employer’s share of the repayment.
<p>An agreement is required if more than one member of the group of eligible employers received wage subsidy amounts for one or both of the following time periods:
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For this purpose, the group of eligible employers includes all of the following, if they have received a wage subsidy amount for the relevant time period:
	<ul>
		<li>you</li>
		<li>your public parent corporation</li> 
<li>each other eligible employer controlled in that claim period by you or your public parent corporation</li>
</ul>
	<p>An agreement allows the members of the group to determine how much executive compensation repayment amount for the relevant time period will be repaid by each of them. Each member of the group must enter into the agreement for the relevant time period, filed in prescribed form.
<p><strong>Related form:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/rc224/rc224-22e.pdf">Executive Compensation Repayment Amount Agreement (RC224)</a></p>

    <h3>Assigning percentages under an agreement</h3>
	  	  <p>The agreement must assign a percentage (including 0%) to each member of the group. The percentages assigned to group members under the agreement must total 100%.
When assigning percentages, <strong>no member of the group can be assigned a percentage that would create a greater repayment obligation than the total of its wage subsidy amounts for the relevant time period</strong>. If no agreement is made (for example, where there is only one corporation in the group that received the wage subsidy), the default percentage is 100%. 
The percentage applicable to each member of the group may be different for each executive compensation repayment time period.
</p>
    <h2 id="h-5">How to repay excess subsidy amounts you received</h2>
	  	  <p>If you have an executive compensation repayment amount, you have effectively received more wage subsidy than you were entitled to. </p>
<!--<p>An amount of wage subsidy you claimed that you were not entitled to is called an <strong>excess refund</strong> of wage subsidy.</p>-->
<p>If you have received an excess amount of wage subsidy, you must <a href="change or cancel your claim">adjust your wage subsidy claims</a> for the relevant claim periods to remove the amount of excess subsidy at line C.</p>

<p>The specific claim adjustments you need to make are determined separately for the two executive compensation repayment time periods:</p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23 (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 and later (claims covering December 19, 2021, and later)</li>
</ul></p>
<p>Within each time period, you must repay <strong>later</strong> wage subsidy amounts first, until either the total of your executive compensation repayment amount has been subtracted from your wage subsidy claims, or you have no more wage subsidy amounts to pay back.</p>
<p>An excess amount of wage subsidy is deemed to have become payable to the Receiver General on the date it was paid to you.</p>
<h3>Calculating excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 17 to 23</h3>

<p>You must calculate your excess wage subsidy amount for <strong>each payment you received</strong> for claim periods 17 through 23. The excess wage subsidy amount is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
 	<li class="cnjnctn-col">
	  <p>The amount of wage subsidy for claim periods 17 to 23 paid on that particular payment date</p></li>
	<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The amount determined by the formula <strong>A &minus; B</strong>, where:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A</strong> is the eligible employer’s compensation repayment amount for claim periods 17 to 23 </li>
			<li><strong>B</strong> is the total of all excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 17 to 23 determined after the date of that wage subsidy payment</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
<h3>Calculating excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 24 and later</h3>

<p>You must calculate your excess wage subsidy amount for <strong>each payment you received</strong> for claim periods 24 and later. The excess wage subsidy amount is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
	<li class="cnjnctn-col">
	  <p>The amount of wage subsidy for claim periods 24 and later paid on that particular payment date</p></li>
	<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The amount determined by the formula <strong>A &minus; B</strong>, where:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A</strong> is the <strong>greater</strong> of:
			<ul>
				<li>the eligible employer’s executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 and subsequent claim periods, or</li>
				<li>the amount of <a href="#h-2-2">taxable dividends</a> paid by you or your subsidiary to an individual who is a holder of common shares</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>B</strong> is the total of all excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 24 and later determined after the date of that wage subsidy payment
			</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<summary>Example 1: Period 17 to 23, when the subsidy received is the lesser amount</summary>

<p>ABC Corporation is an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It does not control any other eligible employers, and is it not controlled by another public corporation.</p>

<p>ABC Corporation’s fiscal period for Canadian tax and securities law purposes coincides with the calendar year. In 2019, the total amount of compensation that it was required
to disclose in its Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers (i.e. form 51-102F6) was $4,500,000. In 2021, the total amount of compensation that it was required to disclose in form 51-102F6 was $8,000,000.</p>

<p>During claim periods 17 to&nbsp;21, for which ABC Corporation claimed the wage subsidy, it had no eligible employees on leave with pay. These are the wage subsidy amounts
ABC Corporation was paid in respect of those claim periods and the dates on which those amounts were paid:</p>

<p>ABC Corporation’s executive compensation repayment amount is $3,500,000, which is the lesser of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for claim periods&nbsp;17 to
     23 (i.e. $1,250,000 + $1,050,000 + $950,000 + $750,000 &plus; $250,000 = $4,250,000),
     and</li>
 <li>the amount by which its 2021 executive compensation exceeded its 2019 executive compensation (i.e.
     $8,000,000 - $4,500,000 = $3,500,000)</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the executive compensation wage subsidy repayment rule, the wage subsidy amounts paid to ABC
Corporation will be reduced by its executive compensation repayment amount, with the later wage subsidy amounts being reduced first.</p>

<p>XYZ Corporation is an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It does not control any other eligible employers, and is it not controlled by another public corporation.</p>

<p>XYZ Corporation’s fiscal period for Canadian tax and securities law purposes coincides with the calendar year. In 2019, the total amount of compensation that it was required
to disclose in its Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers (i.e. form 51-102F6) was $6,000,000. In 2021, the total amount of
compensation that it was required to disclose in form 51-102F6 was $12,000,000.</p>

<p>During claim periods 17 to&nbsp;23, for which XYZ Corporation claimed a wage subsidy, it had no eligible employees on leave with pay. These are the wage subsidy amounts XYZ
Corporation was paid in respect of those claim periods and the dates on which those amounts were paid:</p>

&minus; $1,800,000). This excess wage subsidy amount of $1,500,000 is deemed to have become payable to the Receiver General by XYZ Corporation on February 16, 2022.</li>
</ol>

<p>After the application of the executive compensation wage subsidy repayment rule, XYZ Corporation will have been entitled to a wage subsidy amount of only $300,000 in respect of claim periods&nbsp;24 to 28, in
contrast to the $5,800,000 in wage subsidy amounts that were originally paid to it for those claim periods.</p>
	
	<p>XYZ Corporation will change the line C amounts of their subsidy claims for periods 24 to 28 accordingly:</p>
