	<h2 id="h-1">What the executive compensation rule is and who it applies to</h2>
    
	  	<p>If you are a <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="public-co" href="#public-co">publicly <span class="nowrap">traded corporation<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> or you have a public parent corporation (you are controlled by a publicly traded corporation), you may need to repay all or part of the following wage subsidy amounts you received for claim periods 17 to 28 (claim periods beginning after June 5, 2021):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS)</li>
				<li>Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program (THRP) &ndash; wage portion only</li>
					<li>Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program (HHBRP) &ndash; wage portion only</li>
	</ul>
		<p>Whether you need to repay a wage subsidy you received depends on the claim period for which you received wage subsidy.</p>
	  <dl>
		  <dt>Claim periods 17 to 23</strong> (claims covering June 6 to December 18, 2021)</dt>
	  <dd>You may need to repay a wage subsidy you received if your <a href="#h-2">executive remuneration</a> (or your public parent corporation’s, if you have one) for specified executives for the 2021 calendar year exceeds the executive remuneration for specified executives for the 2019 calendar year.</dd>
	  <dt>Claim periods 24 to 28 (claims covering December 19, 2021, to May 7, 2022)</dt>
<dd>You may need to repay a wage subsidy you received if:
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or cnjnctn-xs">
		<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>Your <a href="#h-2">executive remuneration</a> (or your public parent corporation’s, if you have one) for specified executives for the 2022 calendar year exceeds the executive remuneration for specified executives for the 2019 calendar year</p></li>

	</ul>
	  </dd>
	  </dl>
<p>If any of these situations apply to you, you are subject to the executive compensation repayment rule. You must calculate an executive compensation repayment amount for each repayment time period to determine if you need to repay wage subsidy amounts you received.</p>	
			
	  <h2 id="h-2">What executive remuneration is</h2>
	  	  <p>For the purposes of calculating the executive compensation repayment amount, executive remuneration is generally determined according to the laws under which you (or your public parent corporation) are required to make disclosures to shareholders. If you have a public parent corporation, use the amount of executive remuneration required to be disclosed by your public parent corporation.</p>
<p><strong>If you (or your public parent corporation) are required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws</strong>, executive remuneration is the total amount of compensation that is required to be disclosed in the Statement of Executive Compensation for Named Executive Officers ("Statement of Executive Compensation"), pursuant to the Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 51-102, Continuous Disclosure Obligations. 
	Generally, this amount is the total compensation reported for the:</p>
	<ul>
			  <li>Chief Executive Officer</li>
			  <li>Chief Financial Officer, and</li>
			  <li>three other most highly compensated executives</li>
</ul>
	  
<p><strong>If you (or your public parent corporation) are required to make a similar disclosure to shareholders under the laws of another jurisdiction</strong> (but are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws), executive remuneration is the amount of total compensation reported in that similar disclosure (limited to the five most highly compensated individuals).</p>

	  <p><strong>If you (or your public parent corporation) are not required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws or a similar disclosure under the laws of another jurisdiction</strong>, executive remuneration is the amount that you would report if you were required to make disclosures to shareholders under Canadian securities laws, using the method for preparing the Statement of Executive Compensation.</p>
    <h3>Calculating executive remuneration for a calendar year</h3>
	  	  <p>Executive remuneration is determined by calendar year. If your fiscal period does not coincide with the calendar year, you must prorate the executive remuneration according to the number of days in the fiscal period that fall within that particular calendar year.</p>
    
		
	<h2 id="h-3">Calculating the amount you need to repay</h2>
	  	  <p>The calculation of the executive compensation repayment amount is different for the two time periods:
	      <p>For <strong>claim periods 17 to 23</strong> you must calculate an executive compensation repayment amount.</p>
	      <p>For <strong>claim periods 24 to 28</strong> you must calculate two amounts, to see which is greater:</p>
		      <ul>
			      <li>an executive compensation repayment amount</li>
				      <li>the amount of applicable taxable dividends you paid</li>
	      </ul>
</ul></p>
	
	    <h3 id="h-3-1">Determining an executive compensation repayment amount as part of a group</h3>
	  	  <p>If you are part of a group of eligible employers, your executive compensaton repayment amount is calculated according to the percentage assigned to you under a group agreement.</p>
			  <p>For the purposes of the executive compensation repayment amount calculation, the group of eligible employers includes all of the following, if that member received a wage subsidy amount for the relevant time period:
	<ul>
		<li>you</li>
		<li>your public parent corporation</li> 
<li>each other eligible employer controlled in that claim period by you or your public parent corporation</li>
</ul>
<p>You must complete an agreement (form RC224) if more than one member of the group of eligible employers received wage subsidy amounts for one or both of the following time periods:
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 to 28</li>
</ul></p>
	<p>An agreement allows the members of the group to determine their executive compensation repayment amount for the relevant time period. Each member of the group must enter into an agreement for the relevant time period, filed in prescribed form and manner.
<p><strong>Related form:</strong> <a href="https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/cra-arc/formspubs/pbg/rc224/rc224-22e.pdf">Executive Compensation Repayment Amount Agreement (RC224)</a></p>

    <h4>Assigning percentages under an agreement</h4>
	  	  <p>The agreement must assign a percentage (including 0%) to each member of the group. The percentages assigned to group members under the agreement must total 100%.
When assigning percentages, <strong>no member of the group can be assigned a percentage that would create a greater repayment obligation than the total of its wage subsidy amounts for the relevant time period</strong>. If no agreement is made (for example, where there is only one eligible employer in the group that received the wage subsidy), the default percentage is 100%. 
The percentage allocated to each member of the group may be different for each executive compensation repayment time period.
</p>
	
	
    <h3 id="h-3-2">Executive compensation repayment amount calculation for claim periods 17 to 23</h3>
	
	  	  <p>For claim periods 17 to 23, the executive compensation repayment amount for an eligible employer is determined by the formula <strong>A &times; B</strong>, where:
<p><strong>A</strong> is:
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="#h-3-1">percentage assigned to the eligible employer under a group agreement</a>, or</li>
	<li>in any other case, 100%</li>
</ul>
	<strong>B</strong> is the <strong>lesser</strong> of <strong>C or D</strong>, where:
<ul>
	<li><strong>C</strong> is the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for claim periods 17 to 23 received in respect of active eligible employees of:
		<ul>
		<li>the eligible employer</li>
		<li>the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
		<li>each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant time period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any</li>
		</ul></li><br />
	<li><strong>D</strong> is the greater of either zero or:
		<ul><li>the amount of executive remuneration of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;for 2021</li>
			<li><strong>minus</strong> the amount of such executive remuneration for 2019</li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>
<section class="alert alert-info">
	<h4 id="excess-1723">Carry-forward executive remuneration amount from claim periods 17 to 23</h4>
		<p>If the executive remuneration from 2021 minus the amount from 2019 (amount <strong>D</strong>) is <strong>higher</strong> than the wage subsidy received (amount <strong>C</strong>) in the calculation above, you (or the members of your group) have <strong>carry-forward executive remuneration amount</strong> for periods 17 to 23. You must include this carry-forward remuneration amount when calculating your executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 to 28. The carry-forward executive remuneration amount from periods 17 to 23 equals <strong>D minus C</strong>. </p>
	<p>If all of the executive remuneration from 2021 minus the amount from 2019 is set off against the wage subsidy amounts received for claim periods 17 to 23 (<strong>C</strong> is higher than <strong>D</strong>), you do not have a carry-forward executive remuneration amount to include in your executive compensation repayment amount calculation for claim periods 24 to 28.</p>
	</section>
	
	
    <h3 id="h-3-3">Executive compensation repayment amount calculation for claim periods 24 to 28</h3>
	  	  <p>The calculation of the executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 to 28 is similar to the calculation for claim periods 17 to 23. However, the calculation for claim periods 24 to 28 also includes any <strong>carry-forward executive remuneration amount from claim periods 17 to 23</strong>. </p>
<p>For claim periods 24 to 28, the executive compensation repayment amount for an eligible employer equals <strong>A &times; B</strong>, where:
<p><strong>A</strong> is:</p> 
<ul>
	<li>the <a href="#h-3-1">percentage assigned to the eligible employer under a group agreement</a>, or</li>
	<li>in any other case, 100%</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>B</strong> is the <strong>lesser</strong> of <strong>C</strong> or <strong>D</strong>, where:</p>
<ul><li><strong>C</strong> is the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount for claim periods 24 to 28 received in respect of active eligible employees of:
<ul>
<li>the eligible employer</li>
<li>the public parent corporation, if any, and</li>
<li>each other eligible employer controlled in the relevant time period by the eligible employer or the public parent corporation, if any</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li><strong>D</strong> is the total, if it is greater than zero, of:
<ul>
	<li>any <a href="#excess-1723">carry-forward executive remuneration amount from claim periods 17 to 23</a></li>
	<li><strong>plus</strong> the amount of executive remuneration of the eligible employer&mdash;or of the public parent corporation, if any&mdash;for 2022</li>
	<li><strong>minus</strong> the amount of such executive remuneration for 2019</li>
		</ul></li>
</ul>
</p>


<h3 id="h-3-4">Repayment due to taxable dividends for periods 24 to 28</h2>
	
<p>You may need to return a wage subsidy you received if you 
<ul>
	<li>paid <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="taxable-div" href="#taxable-div">taxable <span class="nowrap">dividends<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> in any claim period 24 through 28 to an individual who was a holder of your <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="common-shares" href="#common-shares">common <span class="nowrap">shares<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a>, and </li>
	<li>received a wage subsidy amount for any claim period 24 to 28</li>
	</ul>

<p>If you are in this situation, you must determine if the total amount of dividends you paid is greater than your executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 to 28. The greater amount will <a href="#repay24-28">determine how much wage subsidy you must repay</a>.</p>


    <h2 id="h-4">How to repay excess wage subsidy amounts you received</h2>
	  	  <p>If you have an executive compensation repayment amount, or, for claim periods 24 to 28, if you paid <a href="#h-2-1">certain taxable dividends</a>, you have effectively received more wage subsidy than you were entitled to. In other words, you have received an excess wage subsidy amount.</p>

<p>The excess wage subsidy amount you need to repay is determined separately for the two repayment time periods:</p>
			  <ul>
				  <li>claim periods 17 to 23</li>
				  <li>claim periods 24 to 28</li>
</ul></p>
<p>For each time period, you must repay <strong>later</strong> wage subsidy amounts first, until the total of your excess wage subsidy amount has been subtracted from your wage subsidy claims.</p>
<p>You will need to:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="change-or-cancel.html#h-2">adjust your wage subsidy claims</a> for the relevant claim periods to remove the amount of excess wage subsidy at line C</li>
	<li><a href="return-payment.html">repay the excess wage subsidy you received</a></li>
</ul>

<p>An excess wage subsidy amount is deemed to have become payable to the Receiver General on the date it was paid to you.</p>

<h3>Calculating excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 17 to 23</h3>

<p>If your executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 17 to 23 is <strong>equal</strong> to the total amounts of wage subsidy you received for claim periods 17 to 23, you must return all of the wage subsidy payments you received for these periods.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you must calculate your excess wage subsidy amount for <strong>each payment you received</strong> for claim periods 17 to 23. The excess wage subsidy amount in respect of a particular claim period is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
 	<li class="cnjnctn-col">
	  <p>The amount of wage subsidy for any claim period from 17 to 23 paid on that particular payment date</p></li>
	<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The amount determined by the formula <strong>A &minus; B</strong>, where:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A</strong> is the eligible employer’s executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 17 to 23 </li>
			<li><strong>B</strong> is the total of all excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 17 to 23 determined after the date of that wage subsidy payment</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>

<h3 id="repay24-28">Calculating excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 24 to 28</h3>
<p>If your executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 to 28 or the amount of <a href="#h-2-1">taxable dividends</a> you paid for claim periods 24 to 28 (whichever is greater) is <strong>equal</strong> to the total amounts of wage subsidy you received for claim periods 24 to 28, you must return all of the wage subsidy payments you received for these periods.</p>

<p>Otherwise, you must calculate your excess wage subsidy amount for <strong>each payment you received</strong> for claim periods 24 to 28. The excess wage subsidy amount in respect of a particular payment is the <strong>lesser</strong> of:</p>
	<ul class="list-unstyled cnjnctn-type-or">
	<li class="cnjnctn-col">
	  <p>The amount of wage subsidy for any claim period from 24 to 28 paid on that particular payment date</p></li>
	<li class="cnjnctn-col"><p>The amount determined by the formula <strong>A &minus; B</strong>, where:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>A</strong> is the <strong>greater</strong> of:
			<ul>
				<li>the eligible employer’s executive compensation repayment amount for claim periods 24 to 28, or</li>
				<li>the amount of <a href="#h-2-1">taxable dividends</a> paid by the eligible employer to an individual who is a holder of their common shares</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>B</strong> is the total of all excess wage subsidy amounts for claim periods 24 to 28 determined after the date of that wage subsidy payment</li>

	<summary>Example 1: Period 17 to 23, when the wage subsidy received is the lesser amount</summary>

<p>ABC Corporation is an eligible employer whose shares of capital stock are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange. It does not control any other eligible employers, and it is not controlled by another public corporation.</p>

<p>ABC Corporation’s fiscal period for Canadian tax and securities law purposes coincides with the calendar year. In 2019, the total amount of compensation that it was required
to disclose in its Statement of Executive Compensation was $4,500,000. In 2021, the total amount of compensation that it was required to disclose was $8,000,000.</p>

<p>During claim periods 17 to&nbsp;21, for which ABC Corporation claimed the wage subsidy, it had no eligible employees on leave with pay. These are the wage subsidy amounts
ABC Corporation was paid in respect of those claim periods and the dates on which those amounts were paid:</p>

<p>ABC Corporation’s executive compensation repayment amount is $3,500,000, which is the lesser of:</p>

<ul>
 <li>the total of all amounts, each of which is a wage subsidy amount paid for claim periods&nbsp;17 to
     23 (i.e. $1,250,000 + $1,050,000 + $950,000 + $750,000 &plus; $250,000 = $4,250,000),

     $8,000,000 - $4,500,000 = $3,500,000)</li>
</ul>

<p>Under the executive compensation repayment rule for claim periods 17 to 23, the wage subsidy amounts paid to ABC
Corporation will be reduced by its executive compensation repayment amount, with the later wage subsidy amounts being reduced first.</p>
