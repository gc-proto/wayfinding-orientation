    <h2 id="h-1">Who are eligible employees</h2>
    <p>An eligible employee is a person who was employed by you (the eligible employer) primarily in Canada throughout the claim period.</p>
    <p>Employee eligibility depends on the person being <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q13-1">employed in Canada, not living in Canada</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="retro">Retroactively hiring and paying employees</h3>
    <p>Employees you laid off can become eligible retroactively, as long as you rehire and pay them so they meet the eligibility criteria for the claim period. You must rehire and pay these employees before you include them in your subsidy claim.</p>
    <p>Read more about <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#h_4">employee eligibility</a> in the CEWS technical questions and answers.</p>
    <h3 id="nonarm">Arm’s-length and non-arm's-length eligible employees</h3>
    <div id="nonarm-cntnt">
      <p>You will be asked whether an employee is arm’s length or not when you calculate your subsidy amount, because <strong>the subsidy is calculated differently</strong> for eligible non-arm’s-length and arm’s-length employees.</p>
      <dl class="dl-horizontal">
        <dt>Arm's-length employees</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>For most small businesses, workers are usually <strong>arm’s-length</strong> employees unless they are an owner or an owner’s family member.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt>Non-arm's-length employees</dt>
        <dd>In a small business, a <strong>non-arm’s-length</strong> employee would most often be:
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>a business owner</li>
            <li>a member of an owner’s immediate family (for example, a spouse, parent, child, sibling, grandparent, or grandchild)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It’s possible (but less common) for a non-arm’s-length employee relationship to exist between unrelated people, depending on the circumstances. </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>If you’re not sure about whether an employee is considered arm’s length or non-arm’s length, or have a business involving more complex control (like a corporation, trust, or partnership), you can read more about <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/technical-information/income-tax/income-tax-folios-index/series-1-individuals/folio-5-transfer-income-property-rights-third-parties/income-tax-folio-s1-f5-c1-related-persons-dealing-arms-length.html">specific relationships that are considered non-arm’s length</a>.</p>

        <dd>Are employees who were temporarily furloughed for one or more full weeks in the claim period but were still receiving pay for those weeks. To be considered on leave with pay for a week within a claim period, an employee must:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>not</strong> have worked at all during the full week</li>
            <li><strong>not</strong> have been on paid absence (such as vacation leave, sick leave, or a sabbatical)</li>

	    <p>Employees on leave with pay are never included in the calculation of the Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP), Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program (THRP), or Hardest-Hit Businesses Recovery Program (HHBRP).

 <p>The amount for employees from week to week is determined automatically when you use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-calculate-subsidy-amount.html#h-3">online calculator or spreadsheet</a>.</p>
	    <h4>Refund of employer-paid contributions for employees on leave with pay</h4>
	<div id="refund-contrib"
	   <p>For <strong>CEWS claims for periods 1 to 21</strong>, you can claim a 100% refund of the employer-paid part of contributions made for a week on behalf of any eligible employees who are on leave with pay for that full week in the claim period.</p>
        <div class="alert alert-info">
          <p>A proposed change <a href="/en/department-finance/news/2021/07/extending-business-support-measures-through-the-pandemic.html">announced on July&nbsp;30,&nbsp;2021</a>, would remove the ability to claim CPP, QPP, EI, and QPIP amounts for employees on leave with pay for claim periods&nbsp;20 and later.</p>
        </div>
        <p>The employer-paid contributions that can be refunded for employees on leave with pay for the week include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Employment Insurance (EI)</li>
          <li>the Quebec Parental Insurance Plan (QPIP)</li>
          <li>the Canada Pension Plan (CPP)</li>

    <h3 id="worksharing">Employees participating in a Work-Sharing benefit program</h3>
    <div id="worksharing-cntnt">
      <p>If you are participating in Employment and Social Development Canada's <a href="/en/employment-social-development/corporate/notices/coronavirus/employers-factsheet.html">Work-Sharing benefit program</a>, you will need to know the amount of EI benefits received by your eligible employees through the program during the claim period.</p>
      <p>If you don’t have the exact amount of work-sharing benefits received by your employees, we will accept a reasonable estimate.</p>
    </div>

    	<h2 id="crhpbase">Incremental and base period pay for the CRHP</h2>		
	   <p>The CRHP is calculated using how much your overall pay (eligible remuneration) to your employees has increased from the time of the <strong>base period</strong> of March 14 to April 10, 2021, to the time of the claim period. The base period dates are the same as CEWS claim period 14.</p>
		   <p>This change in overall pay is referred to as your incremental remuneration. To calculate this amount, you will need to know:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>which of your employees were eligible and actively working in the claim period</li>
		  <li>which of your employees were eligible and actively working in the base period</li>
		  <li>how much your pay was for your active eligible employees</li>
	  </ul>
<p>This means there are three time periods you will need to know the pay amounts for your active eligible employees to calculate the CRHP:</p>
<ul>
	<li>each week of the 4-week claim period you are applying for</li>
	<li>each week of the 4-week base period (March 14 to April 10, 2021)</li>
	<li>for non-arm's-length employees, the average weekly amount for the <a href="baselineremuneration">pre-crisis pay period</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can use the online calculator to determine this amount. You only need to find your total amount of employees and their eligible pay for the base period (March 14 to April 10, 2021) one time. This base period does not change from one claim period to the next.</p>
		
		<h2 id="h-2">Determining employee pay (eligible remuneration)</h2>
    <p>Eligible remuneration is normally the type of employee pay you would make payroll deductions on.</p>
    <p>Eligible remuneration includes amounts such as:</p>
    <ul class="fa-ul">
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>salary</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>wages</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>certain taxable benefits</li>
      <li><span class="fas fa-check text-success fa-li"></span>fees and commissions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Eligible remuneration <strong>does not</strong> include amounts such as:</p>

		<h3 id="week">Claim period pay per week</h3>
    <div id="week-cntnt">
      <p>For all eligible employees, you will need to know how much eligible remuneration you paid them in respect of each week in the claim period. They must have received their pay before you apply for the subsidy.</p>
      <p>If your pay schedule doesn’t align with the wage subsidy claim period dates, you will have to manually calculate how much you paid the employee in respect of each week. It doesn’t matter whether the employee receives their paycheque at the end of the week, at the end of the month, or another time, as long as you use the actual amount they were paid that relates to that week. You can’t use an average of daily wages.</p>
      <p>If you pay employees weekly or bi-weekly, you can use the calculator spreadsheet to enter your employees’ pay.</p>

    <h3 id="baselineremuneration">Calculate the pre-crisis pay (baseline remuneration)</h3>
    <div id="baselineremuneration-cntnt">
      <p>Pre-crisis pay (baseline remuneration) is an average amount of eligible remuneration the employee received in a week during a specific period before March&nbsp;15, 2020.</p>
	    <p>This amount is calculated for each individual employee and is <strong>not</strong> the same thing as calculating the overall <a href="#crhpbase">CRHP base period remuneration</a>.</p>
      <p>There is more than one pre-crisis pay period option you may use when calculating an employee’s pre-crisis pay for a claim period. To get the most potential benefit, choose the pre-crisis pay period that has the highest weekly average for that employee.</p>
      <p>If you have hired <strong>new eligible employees</strong> who did not work for you prior to March 15, 2020, their pre-crisis pay will be $0.</p>

          <p>This means the period covered by the remuneration payment. For example, if the pre-crisis pay period selected is January 1 to March 15, 2020, and the employee is paid monthly on the 16th of every month (for hours worked the previous month), there would be two pays in that period. The January 16th pay would cover the period from Dec 1 to 31, 2019 (31 days) and the February 16th pay would cover January 1 to 31, 2020 (31 days). </p>
