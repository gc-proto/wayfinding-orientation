                     <p>Your drop in revenue is calculated by comparing your eligible revenue during the reference period with your eligible revenue from a previous period (baseline revenue).</p>
                     <p>There is <strong>no minimum revenue drop</strong> required to qualify for the subsidy. The rate your revenue has dropped is only used to calculate how much subsidy you receive for these periods.</p>

                           <p>If your normal accounting method is the accrual method, you can choose (elect) to use the cash method (and vice versa), but once you choose you must use the same accounting method for all your claims.</p>
