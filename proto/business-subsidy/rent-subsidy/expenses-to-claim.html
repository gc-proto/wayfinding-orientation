            <summary>Example: Eligible net lease expenses </summary>

              <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Tenant&nbsp;A is an eligible entity for the purpose of a rent subsidy. They operate a retail store in a shopping mall. </p>

              <p>Tenant&nbsp;A leases its premises under a net lease with Landlord&nbsp;B. The lease was entered into before October 9, 2020. Tenant&nbsp;A and Landlord&nbsp;B deal at arm’s length.</p>

              <p>Under the net lease, Landlord&nbsp;B provides all of the tenants with the following services for the shopping mall: </p>

              <ul>
                <li>heating, air conditioning and ventilation (HVAC),</li> 
                <li>electricity, and</li> 
                <li>water.</li>  
              </ul>

              <p>Landlord&nbsp;B also pays the property taxes and insurance for the shopping mall.</p>  

              <p>The lease states that Landlord&nbsp;B will not provide phone or internet service for the tenants and the tenant is responsible for paying their phone and internet costs.</p>  

              <p>The net lease requires that each tenant pay their share of the HVAC, electricity, water, property taxes and insurance (the “property expenses”).  Landlord&nbsp;B calculates this amount and invoices each tenant for their property expenses each month.</p>

              <p>The net lease states that each month, Tenant&nbsp;A is required to pay:</p> 

              <ul>
                	<li>a base rent <strong>and</strong> </li>
                	<li>its share of the property expenses according to the invoice they receive from Landlord&nbsp;B.</li>                 
              </ul>

              <p>These payments are eligible rent expenses for Tenant&nbsp;A because Landlord&nbsp;B requires that they both be paid under the net lease if Tenant&nbsp;A wants to lease space in the mall. They are expenses that relate to operating the qualifying property.</p>

              <p>Tenant&nbsp;A also pays its monthly invoice for phone and internet service to its provider.</p>

              <p>Tenant&nbsp;A must pay for these services if they choose to have phone and internet service for their business. These payments are not regular instalments of operating expenses customarily charged to the tenant under the lease agreement.</p>  

              <p>As a result, the amounts paid by Tenant&nbsp;A for phone and internet are not eligible rent expenses.</p>

              <p>Expenses such as electricity are <strong>not</strong> eligible rent expenses if the lease agreement</p> 

              <ul>
                <li>does not require a tenant to pay the amount under the lease but states only that the tenant is responsible for paying their own electricity, whether it is paid to the landlord or to a third party such as an energy distributor, or</li>
                <li>says nothing about who is responsible for paying for electricity – in such a case, it is assumed that the tenant is responsible for paying the expense although this is not a requirement under the lease.</li> 
              </ul>

            </details>
            </li>
            </ul>
		      <p>Amounts that you pay under a net lease are considered rent. You will add all of these expenses to the “Rent” field in the calculator when you calculate your subsidy amounts.</p>

					  <summary>Example: Landlord applies credits from CECRA payments</summary>
						<p>Heather rents a space to Antonio for his clothing store. His regular monthly rent is $1000.</p>
						<p>Heather received $1500 from CECRA for Antonio’s rent for July and August, but Antonio had already paid his rent in full for those months. </p>
						<p>Instead of reimbursing Antonio, Heather decides to apply a $500 credit to his monthly rent for the next 3 months.</p>
						<p>This means that for September, October, and November, Antonio is paying $500 per month for his rent.</p>
						<p>Antonio is eligible to apply for CERS in the first claim period. </p>
						<p>Antonio can claim the full $1000 per month  that he normally pays to rent his store, even though he is only paying Heather $500 for 3 months. This is because the $500 credit he is receiving from Heather is to reimburse him for the CECRA payments she received on his behalf.</p>

		<p>The lockdown support top-up for the CERS, THRP, and HHBRP may be available to eligible property owners with non-arm's length tenants, if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the tenant uses the qualifying property in the course of its regular activities</li>
				<li>that property is subject to a lockdown</li>
				<li>the tenant must shut their doors or significantly restrict their activities under a public health order, and </li>
				<li>the property owner meets all other applicable conditions required to <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-rent-subsidy/cers-calculate-subsidy-amount.html#lockdown-eligibility" target="_blank">qualify for the lockdown support top-up</a></li>
			</ul>
		<p>The  lockdown support top-up for an eligible property owner with tenants not at arm’s length is calculated based on its own eligible expenses and not the commercial rent paid or payable by its non-arm’s length tenant(s).</p>
