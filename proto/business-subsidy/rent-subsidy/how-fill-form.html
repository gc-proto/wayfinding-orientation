              <p>Review your Claim summary before submitting.</p>
              <p>If your claim is $2.00 or less you will see a checkbox. Claims under $2.00 will not be processed.  Check the box to acknowledge this.</p>
              <p><strong>Attestation</strong></p>
              <p>Attestation is the act of signing of a formal document to confirm that you are bound by its contents. An attestation is required to make a CERS claim.</p>
              <p>If you are the individual with principal responsibility for the financial activities of the organization making the claim, you must complete and submit the Attestation for owner/manager and/or senior employees.</p>
              <p>This may be the business owner or an employee of the business, such as a Chief Financial Officer, a Vice-President, an accountant, or another senior employee who manages the organization's finances.</p>
              <p>If you are applying on behalf of your own business, the attestation form will be available within the online application itself.</p>
              <p><strong>Representatives</strong> need to do two things regarding attestation and form completion. First, they need to make sure that they have obtained the Attestation for owner/managers and/or senior employees:</p>
              <ul>
              <li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc665.html">Attestation for owner/managers and/or senior employees (comptroller/VP Finance/CFO) of an eligible organization applying for the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy</a></li>
              </ul>
              <p>This form must be completed and signed by the individual who has principal responsibility of the financial activities of the eligible entity (the business or other organization). An electronic signature is permitted. The CRA can request to see the signed copy of this attestation at any time.</p>
              <p>Then, while completing the online application on behalf of their client, the representative must complete the confirmation section at the end of the application. This includes a confirmation that the attestation will be provided upon request and without delay in prescribed form and manner, and that failure to do so could result in the application of penalties or the reassessment of the claim to deny benefits.</p>
              <p>Penalties may also apply in cases of fraudulent claims. The penalties may include fines or even imprisonment.</p>
              <p>In addition, if someone knowingly, or under circumstances amounting to gross negligence makes, or is involved in the making of, a false statement or omission in its CERS application for a claim period, they (or the relevant organization) may be liable to a penalty – commonly referred to as the "gross negligence penalty" – of up to 50% of the difference between the amount of CERS that was claimed in its application and the amount of CERS to which it is actually entitled.</p>
