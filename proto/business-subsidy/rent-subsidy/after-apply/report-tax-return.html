	<h2 id="h_1">When to report a rent subsidy on your return</h2>
	<p>A rent subsidy is considered government assistance and is taxable, unless you are exempt from income tax. This includes rent subsidy amounts you received through the:</p>
	  <ul>
		  <li>Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS)</li>
		  <li>Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program (THRP)</li>
		  <li>Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program</li>
	  </ul>
	<p>You must report the subsidy on your income tax or information return for the tax year (fiscal period) in which you are considered to have received it.</p>
	<div class="alert alert-info">
   <p>The rent subsidy is <strong>generally considered to have been received on the last day of the claim period it relates to</strong>. </p>
</div>
	<p>For example, if you applied for and received a rent subsidy for claim period 23 (November 21 to December 18, 2021), we would consider you to have received the amount on December 18, 2021, even if you applied for period 23 in 2022 or received your subsidy amount for period 23 in 2022.</p>
	<h2 id="h_2">How to report a rent subsidy on your return</h2>
	<p>How you report a rent subsidy on your tax or information return depends on the type of entity you are.</p>
	<p>You may be able to elect to reduce your related rent expenses by the amount of government assistance (rent subsidy) you received. Otherwise, you have to include the assistance in your income. </p>
	
	<h3 id="h_3">Corporations</h3>
	<p>Report the amounts of rent subsidy you received for the tax year on both Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (T2SCH1) and the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>
<p>On the GIFI, include the rent subsidy you received at line 8242.</p>
<p>On Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (T2SCH1):</p>
<ul>
<li>On line 605, include a short description clearly identifying each COVID-19 subsidy you received<br> 
Example: “CERS $15.5K”</li>
<li>On the corresponding line 295, enter “0”</li>
<li>If you are a member of a partnership, reflect any rent subsidy amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 129, “Income or loss for tax purposes – partnerships”</li>

	<h3 id="h_7">Tax-exempt entities</h3>
	<p>If you are an income tax-exempt entity (such as a registered charity or a non-profit organization) that has received a rent subsidy amount as an eligible entity, you may have to report the total amount you received on the information return (if any) that applies to your situation, even though this amount is not taxable to you.</p>

	<p>Use the T3010, Registered Charity Information Return to report a rent subsidy amount you received as income.</p>
	<p>If you are a registered charity that does not have to complete Schedule 6, you can report rent subsidy amounts you received as income by checking “Yes” at line 4565, “Did the charity receive any revenue from any level of government in Canada?” of Section D and including the total rent subsidy amount you received for the fiscal period on line 4570.</p>
	<p>Otherwise, include the total rent subsidy amount you received for the tax year on line 4540, “Total revenue received from federal government” of Schedule 6.</p>
