			<h3>Eligibility for COVID-19 business subsidies</h3>
			<p>There are different ways to qualify for wage or rent subsidies if you've been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. If you're not sure which subsidy may fit your situation:</p>
			<ul><li><a href="../determine-eligibility/index.html" >Answer a few questions to see what you may qualify for</a></li></ul>

			<h2>Subsidies you may qualify for under the THRP</h2>
			<!--<p>If you meet the qualifications for the THRP, you will qualify for preferential rates for the wage and rent subsidies.</p>-->
<p>Through the THRP, you may be able to get a subsidy to help cover wages (formerly the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy) and rent (formerly the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy).</p>
			<dl class="dl-horizontal border0">
				<dt>Wage and hiring</dt>
				<dd>
					<p>The wage subsidy will enable you to re-hire workers previously laid off as a result of COVID-19, help prevent further job losses, and better position you to resume normal operations following the crisis.</p>

<p>If your business or organization has at least 1 location that is affected by a qualifying public health restriction, you may be eligible for the Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program (THRP) even if you are not a qualifying tourism or hospitality entity.</p>
				<p>This means:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There was a COVID-19-related public health order in effect during the claim period which required you to close or stop certain business activities at 1 or more locations</li>
					<li>The public health order was in effect for at least 7 days in the claim period</li>
<li>You needed to close or stop certain business activities during the public health order at 1 or more locations</li>
<li>The affected activities accounted for at least approximately 25% of your <strong>total revenue</strong> (not just at the affected locations) during the prior reference period for the claim period</li>
				</ul>
<!--begin content that can be AJAXed-->
				<p>A COVID-19-related public health order must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>be issued by a federal, provincial, or municipal government, or a local health authority</li>
<li>be limited based on at least 1 of these factors:
	<ul>
		<li>geographic boundaries</li>
		<li>type of business or other activity</li>
		<li>risks associated with a particular location</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>result in sanctions or be an offence if you do not comply</li>
	<li>require you to stop some or all of your regular activities while the order is in place

		</ul>-->
	</li>
				</ul>
<!--End of ajaxed content-->
				<p>To be eligible for THRP due to a qualifying public health restriction, you:</p>
				<ul><li>must have a 40% revenue drop for the current claim period when compared to the corresponding prior reference period</li>
					<li>do not need a 12-month average revenue drop</li>
				</ul>

	<summary>Example – Qualifying public health restriction</summary>
<p>Kim owns a tailor shop. They were recently closed 2 times due to a COVID-related public health order:
	<ol>
		<li>October 18 to October 27, 2021, inclusive, and</li>
		<li>November 8 to November 14, 2021, inclusive</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Claim period 22:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>started on October 24, 2021, and </li>
		<li>ended on November 10, 2021</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This means that Kim’s shop was closed for a total of 7 days during claim period 22:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 days at the beginning of period 22 (October 24 to 27 inclusive), and</li>
	<li>3 days at the end of period 22 (November 8 to 10, inclusive)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Because of this, Kim’s tailor shop may be eligible to apply for the Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program for claim period 22 even though they are not a qualifying tourism or hospitality business.
They must have at least a 40% current period revenue drop and meet all other eligibility criteria before they apply.</p>
