				<p>The existing rules continue to apply for the purposes of calculating the claim period revenue drop for the wage and rent subsidies. This means:
   <p>The revenue drop you use to calculate the base subsidy rate is the decline in eligible revenue you experienced when comparing your claim period revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
   <p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 – (Claim period revenue / prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
   <h4 id="deeming">Using the current or prior claim period revenue drop (the “deeming rule”)</h4>
   <p>You will calculate two revenue drops and use the higher result in your base rate calculation. If you use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/subsidy/emergency-wage-subsidy/cews-calculate-subsidy-amount.html#h-3">online calculator or spreadsheet</a> to calculate your subsidy amount, both rates will be calculated when you enter your revenues and the higher rate will automatically be applied.</p>
