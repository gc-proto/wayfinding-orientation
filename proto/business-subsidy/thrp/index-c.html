			<p>A partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction requires that, as a result of an order or decision that meets certain conditions, some or all of your—or your non-arm’s length tenant’s—activities at (or in connection with) a qualifying property have been reduced by means of capacity or similar restriction by 50% or more for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>at least 7 days in a row, <strong>but</strong></li>
	<li>the days can span 2 different claim periods.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In addition, Condition 1 of a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction requires that you—or your non-arm’s length tenants—have at least one qualifying property that is subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction for:</p>
<ul>
	<li>at least 7 days in the claim period, <strong>but</strong></li>
	<li>the days <strong>do not</strong> need to be in a row.</li>
	</ul>
<p><strong>Example – Condition 1 of a qualifying partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction</strong></p>

<p>Jan operates a corporate training business and has 4 different locations where she exclusively offers in-person training events, with each location being a qualifying property.</p>
<p>On two recent occasions, an order required a 50% reduction in capacity for in-person training events at two of Jan’s locations. </p>
<p>How the 7-day criterion works</p>
<p>Step 1: Determine if the two locations meet the 7-day criterion for the purpose of a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction </p>
<p>In both instances, each affected location met all the other conditions required to be subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction.</p>
<p>Dates the capacity was reduced at the two affected locations:</p>
				<ul>
<li>December 13 to December 22, 2021, inclusive (10 days in a row which span claim periods 23 and 24), and</li>
<li>January 12 to January 18, 2022, inclusive (7 days in a row which span claim periods 24 and 25)</li>
				</ul>
<p>This means that, on two occasions, the activities at each of these locations were affected by a 50% reduction in capacity for 7 days in a row or more.</p>

<p>As a result, each of the two qualifying properties meet the condition that some or all activities at (or in connection with) the qualifying property were reduced due to capacity reductions or similar restrictions by 50% or more for at least 7 days in a row for the purpose of a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction.</p>

				<p><strong>Step 2:</strong>  Determine if the two locations meet the 7-day criterion for the purpose of a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction</p>
<p>Claim period 24:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>started on December 19, 2021</li>
					<li>ended on January 15, 2022</li>
				</ul>
<p>Days the capacity was reduced for in-person training events at the two affected locations in claim period 24:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 days at the beginning of period 24 (December 19 to 22, inclusive), and</li>
	<li>4 days at the end of period 24 (January 12 to 15, inclusive)</li>
				</ul>

<p>This means that the 50% reductions in capacity affected the in-person training events at each of these two locations for a total of 8 days each during claim period 24.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
		    <p>Jan’s corporate training business meets Condition 1 of a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction in claim period 24 because:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>one or more qualifying properties were subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction for at least 7 days in the claim period.</li> </p>

            <p>A public health restriction requires that at least approximately 25% of your—or your non-arm’s length tenant’s—qualifying revenues earned in the prior reference period from (or in connection with) the qualifying property were derived from the activities that were required to stop as a result of an order or decision.</p>
		  <p>In addition, Condition 2 of a <strong>qualifying</strong> public health restriction requires that at least approximately 25% of your <strong>total</strong> eligible revenue (together with the eligible revenue of your non-arm’s length tenants) earned in the prior reference period came from the activities that were required to stop as a result of an order or decision. You must consider the eligible revenue in relation to the stopped activities against the eligible revenue from all your qualifying properties, even if some of your qualifying properties were subject to a public health restriction and others were not.   </p> 

		  <p><strong>Example: Condition 2 of a qualifying public health restriction</strong></p>
<p>Kim operates a hairdressing business and has 4 different locations, with each location being a qualifying property.</p>
<p>On two recent occasions, an order required all of the hairdressing activities at two of Kim’s locations to stop. Since hairdressing activities account for all of the activities at the first affected location, Kim chose to close that location. However, Kim kept the second affected location open for sales of haircare products, since she traditionally earned some revenue from those sales. In both instances, each affected location met all the conditions required to be subject to a public health restriction. </p>
<p>How the 25% revenue criterion works  </p>
		  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Determine if each of the two locations meet the 25% revenue criterion for the purpose of a public health restriction</p>

<p>For the purpose of a public health restriction, the 25% revenue criterion is determined on a qualifying property by qualifying property basis. This means that the activities that were required to stop have to account for at least 25% of the eligible revenues earned during the prior reference period from (or in connection with) the affected qualifying property. </p>
<p>For each affected location, the eligible revenue earned in the prior reference period for claim period 22 (November 2019) was $25,000.</p>
<p>For the first affected location, the activities that were required to stop accounted for 100% of the eligible revenues earned ($25,000/$25,000 = 100%) during the prior reference period. </p>
<p>For the second affected location, the activities that were required to stop accounted for $15,000, while the sale of hair care products accounted for the remaining $10,000. Accordingly, 60% of the eligible revenues earned ($15,000/$25,000 = 60%) during the prior reference period were from the activities that were required to stop.</p>
<p>In each case, the activities that were required to stop account for at least 25% of the eligible revenues earned during the prior reference period from (or in connection with) the affected qualifying property. As a result, each of the two qualifying properties meet the 25% revenue criterion for the purpose of a public health restriction.</p>
		  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Determine if the entity meets the 25% revenue criterion for the purpose of a qualifying public health restriction</p>
<p>For the purpose of a qualifying public health restriction, the 25% revenue criterion is based on the entity’s overall eligible revenues. This means that the activities that were required to stop at the locations subject to a public health restriction account for at least approximately 25% of your total eligible revenue (together with the eligible revenue of your non-arm's length tenants) earned during the prior reference period.</p>
<p>As mentioned in Step 1, the eligible revenue earned in the prior reference period for claim period 22 (November 2019) was $25,000 for each affected location. </p>
<p>The eligible revenue earned in the prior reference period from Kim’s other two locations (i.e. her locations not subject to a public health restriction) was also $25,000 each. Accordingly, the total eligible revenue earned by Kim’s hairdressing business in the prior reference period for claim period 22 (November 2019) was $100,000.</p>
<p>For the first affected location (i.e. the location that Kim chose to close), the revenue from the activities that were required to stop  accounted for 25% ($25,000/$100,000) of the total eligible revenue of Kim’s hairdressing business in the prior reference period for claim period 22.</p>
<p>For the second affected location (i.e. the location that Kim chose to keep open), the revenue from the activities that were required to stop accounted for 15% ($15,000/$100,000) of the total eligible revenue of the business in the prior reference period for claim period 22.</p>
<p>Together they account for 40% (25% + 15%) of the total eligible revenue of Kim’s hairdressing business earned during the prior reference period.</p>
<p>This means that at least approximately 25% of the total eligible revenue of the business in the prior reference period came from the activities that were required to stop.</p>
<p>Conclusion:</p>
<p>Kim’s hair salon business meets Condition 2 for a qualifying public health restriction in claim period 22 because:</p>
<ul>
	<li>the activities that were required to stop at the two qualifying properties that were subject to a public health restriction account for at least approximately 25% of its total eligible revenue earned by the business during the prior reference period.
	</li>
		  </ul>
		<del><p>At least one of your qualifying properties must be subject to a qualifying public health restriction.</p>
            <p>If some of your qualifying properties were subject to a qualifying public health restriction and others are not, you must demonstrate that at least 25% of your total eligible revenue (together with the eligible revenue of your non-arm’s length tenant) during the prior reference period came from the qualifying properties that were closed or restricted.</p>
            <p><strong>Examples: Condition 2 of a qualifying public health restriction</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Example 1: Kim’s tailor shop meets condition 2</strong></p>
            <p>Kim’s tailor shop business has 2 qualifying properties that were closed by public health restrictions that lasted for 7 days in a row in claim period 22. The other 2 qualifying properties remained open for business as usual.</p>
            <p>When Kim looks at the total eligible revenue of the business, they determine that each of the 2 qualifying properties that were closed by public health restrictions accounted for <span class="nowrap">12.5%</span> of the total eligible revenue for their business when compared to the prior reference period for claim period 22.</p>
            <p><span class="nowrap">(12.5%) + (12.5%) = 25%</span></p>
            <p>Kim’s business meets condition 2 for a qualifying public health restriction because their qualifying properties that were closed due to a public health restriction account for <span class="nowrap">25%</span> of the total eligible revenue.</p>
            <p><strong>Example 2: Sanjay’s retail business does not meet condition 2</strong> </p>
            <p>Sanjay’s retail business owns 7 qualifying properties.</p>
            <p>Sanjay has 2 qualifying properties that were subject to a public health restriction and closed for 7 days in a row in claim period 22. Because of this, Sanjay’s retail business meets condition 1 for a qualifying public health restriction.</p>
            <p>When Sanjay looks at their total eligible revenue, they determine that the locations that were closed by a public health restriction accounted for only <span class="nowrap"><strong>15%</strong></span> of the total eligible revenue for their business when compared to the prior reference period for claim period 22.</p>
            <p>Sanjay’s retail business does <strong>not</strong> meet condition&nbsp;2 for a qualifying public health restriction because the qualifying properties that were closed due to a public health restriction do <strong>not</strong> account for 25% of Sanjay’s total eligible revenue when compared to the prior reference period for claim period 22.</p>

            <summary id="how-50-percent"><span style="background-color: #FFFFE0">How the 50% revenue criterion works for a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction and a qualifying partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction</span></summary>
            <p>A partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction requires that, as a result of a order or decision that meets certain conditions, some or all of your—or your non-arm’s length tenant’s—activities at (or in connection with) the qualifying property are reduced by means of capacity or similar restrictions by 50% or more, but there is no revenue criterion that must be met to be subject to a partial public health restriction.  </p>
		<p>However , Condition 2 of a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction requires that the activities that were required to be reduced due to capacity or similar restrictions at the qualifying properties that were subject to a partial (capacity-limited) public health restriction account for at least 50% of your <strong>total</strong> eligible revenue (together with the eligible revenue of your non-arm's length tenants) earned during the prior reference period.</p>
 <p>This means you must consider the eligible revenue in relation to the reduced activities against the eligible revenue from all your qualifying properties, even if some of your qualifying properties were subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction and others were not.</p>
 <p><strong>Example: Condition 2 of a qualifying partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction</strong></p>

 <p>Jan operates an in-person corporate training business and has 4 different locations, with each location being a qualifying property.</p>
 <p>On two recent occasions, an order required a 50% reduction in capacity at two of Jan’s locations. In both instances, each affected location met all the conditions required to be subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction.</p>
 <p>Jan’s remaining two locations were not subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction and could operate at full capacity.</p>
 <p>The eligible revenue earned in the prior reference period for claim period 24 (January 2020) from in-person training events at the two locations that were subject to the partial (capacity-limiting) public health restrictions was $100,000 ($50,000 per location) and the eligible revenue from the remaining two locations was $60,000 ($30,000 per location). Accordingly, the total eligible revenue earned by Jan’s in-person corporate training business in the prior reference period was $160,000. </p>

		<p>For the purpose of a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction, the activities that were <strong>reduced</strong> at the locations subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction must account for at least approximately 50% of your total eligible revenue (together with the eligible revenue of your non-arm's length tenants) earned during the prior reference period.</p>
 <p>The activities that were reduced at each of the 2 qualifying properties subject to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction accounted for 31.25% ($50,000/$160,000) of the total eligible revenue of Jan’s corporate training business in the prior reference period for claim period 24. Together they account for 62.50% (31.25% + 31.25%) of the total eligible revenue of the business earned during the prior reference period.</p>
 <p>Conclusion:</p>
		<p>Jan’s corporate training business meets Condition 2 for a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction in claim period 24 because:</p>
		    <ul>
			    <li>the activities that were reduced due to capacity or similar restrictions at the two locations that were subject to the partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction account for at least approximately 50% of its total eligible revenue earned during the prior reference period.</li>
