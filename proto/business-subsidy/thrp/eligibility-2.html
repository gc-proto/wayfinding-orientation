				<h3 id="qphr" class="wb-inv">Qualifying public health restriction criteria</h3>
	
				<p>If your business, charity or non-profit has at least 1 location that is affected by a <strong>qualifying public health restriction</strong> that resulted in a lockdown, you may be eligible for the THRP through the local lockdown component, even if you are not a qualifying tourism or hospitality entity.</p>
				<p>The local lockdown component allows businesses, charities and non-profits that are <strong>not</strong> qualifying tourism or hospitality entities to apply for the THRP.</p>
				<p>This means:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>There was a COVID-19-related <strong>public health order</strong> (lockdown) in effect during the claim period that required you to close or stop certain business activities at 1 or more locations</li>
					<li>The public health order was in effect for at least 7 days <strong>in the claim period</strong></li>
					<li>You needed to close or stop certain business activities during the public health order at 1 or more locations</li>
					<li>The affected activities accounted for at least approximately 25% of your <strong>total revenue</strong> (not only at the affected locations) during the prior reference period for the claim period</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To be eligible for the THRP due to a qualifying public health restriction that resulted in a lockdown, you:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>must have a <strong>40%</strong> revenue drop for the current claim period when compared to the corresponding prior reference period</li>
					<li>do <strong>not</strong> need a 12-month average revenue drop</li>
				</ul>
<details>
	<summary>Example: of a <!--&ndash;--> qualifying local lockdown <!--public health restriction--></summary>
<p>Kim owns a tailor shop. They had to close twice recently due to a COVID-related public health order causing a lockdown.</p>
	<p>Dates closed:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>October 18 to October 27, 2021, inclusive, and</li>
		<li>November 8 to November 14, 2021, inclusive</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Claim period 22:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>started on October 24, 2021, and </li>
		<li>ended on November 10, 2021</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This means that Kim’s shop was closed for a total of 7 days during claim period 22:</p>
<ul>
	<li>4 days at the beginning of period 22 (October 24 to 27, inclusive), and</li>
	<li>3 days at the end of period 22 (November 8 to 10, inclusive)</li>
	</ul>
<p>Because of this, Kim’s tailor shop may be eligible for the Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program (THRP) for claim period 22. Even though they are not a qualifying tourism or hospitality business, they may qualify through the local lockdown component.</p>
	<p>They must have at least a <strong>40%</strong> current period revenue drop and meet all other eligibility criteria before they apply.</p>
