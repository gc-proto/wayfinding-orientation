    <h2 id="h-1">Why you may need to return a payment</h2>
    <p>You may need to return all or part of the subsidy you have already received if you:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>send the CRA any amendments to a previous application</li>
      <li>cancel your application</li>
      <li>make a calculation or data entry error for a claim period</li>
      <li>find out you do not qualify for the subsidy after you receive a payment</li>
      <li>receive a notice from the CRA that, following a review, your claim has been denied or the amount requested has been reduced </li>
	  <li>are a publicly traded company or a subsidiary of such a company, and for claim period 23 or later you paid taxable dividends to an individual who is a holder of common shares of the company or of the subsidiary of the company</li>
      <li>are subject to the <a href="#h-1-5">executive compensation repayment rule</a></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any excess amount of wage subsidy you received that is not returned may be subject to interest.</p>
    <p>To make an arrangement to pay a wage subsidy balance owing, call our <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-contact.html#collections"><span class="nowrap">COVID-19</span> business subsidy payment arrangement line</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="h-1-5">Executive compensation repayment rule</h2>
    <p>If you are a corporation whose shares of capital stock are listed or traded on a stock exchange or public market (or you are controlled by such a publicly listed corporation), you may need to repay all or part of the wage subsidy amounts you received for claim periods 17 and later through the CEWS, THRP, or HHBRP if one or more of the following is true:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the total executive compensation for certain executives in 2021 exceeds the amount for 2019</li>
      <li>the total executive compensation for certain executives in 2022 exceeds the amount for 2019</li>
    </ul>
	 
	<details>
          <summary>Agreement for groups of eligible employers subject to the executive compensation repayment rule</summary>
          <p class="mrgn-tp-md">Groups of eligible employers that are subject to the executive compensation repayment rule must complete an agreement in order to assign a percentage to each member of the group. These percentages are used in determining how much of the total executive compensation repayment amount will be repaid by each member of the group. You can find the form here:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/rc224.html">RC224 Executive Compensation Repayment Amount Agreement</a>  </li>
</ul>
<p>The agreement must:</p>

<ul>
<li>assign a percentage (including 0%) to each member of the group such that the total of all percentages assigned equals 100% </li>
<li>not assign any member of the group a percentage that would create a greater repayment obligation than the total of its wage subsidy amounts for the relevant claim periods </li>
<li>be completed by each member of the group and signed by the individual principally responsible for the financial activities of the eligible employer </li>
</ul>
<p>If no agreement is made, the default percentage is 100% for each eligible employer within the group.</p>
<p>Each agreement applies to either <strong>claim periods 17 to 23 </strong>or <strong>claim period 24 and subsequent claim periods</strong>.  As a result, you may need to complete <strong>two </strong>separate agreements.</p>
<p>Each member of the group must keep the agreement and working papers to support the calculation of the executive compensation repayment amount in case we ask to see them.</p>

</details>  

	  <p>If you are subject to the executive compensation repayment rule, you will need to:</p>
	  <ol>
		  <li>calculate your repayment amount</li>
		  <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-after-apply/change-cancel-claim.html#h-2-2">change or cancel your related claim(s)</a> to remove any wage subsidy you are no longer entitled to</li>
		  <li>return any excess wage subsidy payments you received</li>
