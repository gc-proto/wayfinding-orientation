<div class="alert alert-info">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Making changes to a claim <strong>online</strong> is also available for THRP and HHBRP as of April 25, 2022.</p>
</div>
        <p>To change a THRP, HHBRP or CRHP application or reduce the amount of a previous CEWS application you submitted, go back into the application under the <strong>Payroll</strong> menu of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/e-services-businesses/business-account.html">My Business Account</a>, or</li>

        </ul>
        <p>If you applied using the Web Forms application and need to change your claim, you may <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-contact.html#phone">call CRA’s business enquiries phone number</a>.</p>
        <p>You will need to make sure you continue to meet eligibility requirements for any updated claims, and keep records supporting your wage subsidy claim adjustment.</p>
        <p>When completing the adjustment, you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>your payroll program account number (123456789RP0001, for example)</li>
            <li>to know which claim period you are adjusting</li>
            <li>all of the information necessary to change the amount on each line(s) you would like to adjust</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Representatives who are changing a claim on behalf of an employer must be authorized at level 2 or 3. You will need to have an updated <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-how-apply.html#h-3">Attestation for owner/managers and/or senior employees</a> to support the amended application.</p>
        <h3 id="h-2-1">Switch a claim from one subsidy to another</h3>
        <p>If you claimed the wrong subsidy for a past claim period that is still open for applications and need to apply for a different one, you must cancel your previous claim for that period and then make your new claim.</p>
        <p>For example, if you claimed the CRHP in period 26 and realize <strong>before the deadline</strong> that the THRP would have resulted in a higher subsidy, you must cancel your CRHP claim for period 26 and then submit a THRP claim for period 26.</p>
		
		<h3 id="h-2-2">Change a claim because of an executive compensation repayment</h3>
		<p>If you are a <strong>corporation whose shares of capital stock are listed or traded on a stock exchange or public market</strong> (or you are controlled by such a publicly listed corporation), you may be subject to the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-after-apply/return-payment.html#h-1-5">executive compensation repayment rule</a>.</p>
		<p>If you are subject to the executive compensation repayment rule and have calculated a repayment amount, you must change the relevant past claim(s) to remove any wage subsidy amounts you are no longer entitled to. </p>
		<p><strong>Reduce the basic wage subsidy amount on line C</strong> of the applicable claim(s) by removing the amount you are not entitled to for that claim period.</p>
		<p>You must also <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-after-apply/return-payment.html#h-2">return any excess wage subsidy payments</a> you received.</p>

        <p>To <strong>cancel</strong> an application, follow the same steps as you would to change an application. You will need to return any wage or hiring subsidy you have already received if you cancel your application.</p>
        <h3>Cancel a THRP or HHBRP claim</h3>
        <p>Change the amounts on lines <strong>C</strong> and <strong>G</strong> to <strong>zero</strong> to cancel your claim. Do not change lines c0, c1, or c3.</p>
