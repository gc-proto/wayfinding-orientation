    <h2 id="h-1">When to report a subsidy on your return</h2>
    <p>A wage or rent subsidy is considered government assistance and is taxable, unless you are exempt from income tax. This includes subsidy amounts you received through the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS)</li>
	<li>Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (CERS)</li>
      <li>Canada Recovery Hiring Program (CRHP)</li>
      <li>Tourism and Hospitality Recovery Program (THRP)</li>
      <li>Hardest-Hit Business Recovery Program (HHBRP)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You must report a subsidy on your income tax or information return for the tax year (fiscal period) in which you are considered to have received it.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>The subsidy is <strong>generally considered to have been received on the last day of the claim period it relates to</strong>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>For example, if you applied for and received a subsidy for claim period 23 (November 21 to December 18, 2021), we would consider you to have received the amount on December 18, 2021, even if you applied for period 23 in 2022 or received your subsidy amount for period 23 in 2022.</p>
    <h2 id="h-2">How to report a subsidy on your return</h2>
    <p>How you report a subsidy on your tax or information return depends on the type of entity you are.</p>
    <p>You may be able to elect to reduce your related wage expenses by the amount of wage subsidy (government assistance) you received, or reduce your related rent expenses by the amount of rent subsidy. Otherwise, you have to include the assistance in your income.</p>
    <h3 id="h-2-1">Corporations</h3>
    <p>Report the amounts of wage or rent subsidy you received for the tax year on both Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (T2SCH1) and the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>
    <p>On the GIFI, include the subsidy you received at line 8242.</p>
    <p>On Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return (T2SCH1):</p>
    <ul>
      <li>On line 605, include a short description clearly identifying each COVID-19 subsidy you received<br>
        Example: “CEWS $15,700, CERS $12,595”</li>
      <li>On the corresponding line 295, enter “0” </li>
      <li>If you are a member of a partnership, reflect any subsidy amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 129, “Income or loss for tax purposes – partnerships”</li>

          </summary>
          <p>For the 2020&nbsp;tax year, the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) introduced additional reporting for the T4 slip, Statement of Remuneration Paid.</p>
          <p>If you filed your T4 slips and summary for&nbsp;2020 on or before <span class="nowrap">December 22, 2020</span> you do not need to submit an amended T4.</p>
          <p>For the tax year&nbsp;2020, in addition to reporting employment income in Box&nbsp;14 or Code&nbsp;71, use other information codes when reporting employment income and retroactive payments in the following periods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Code 57: Employment income – March&nbsp;15 to <span class="nowrap">May 9, 2020</span></li>
            <li>Code 58: Employment income – May&nbsp;10 to <span class="nowrap">July 4, 2020</span></li>
            <li>Code 59: Employment income – July&nbsp;5 to <span class="nowrap">August 29, 2020</span></li>
            <li>Code 60: Employment income – August&nbsp;30 to <span class="nowrap">September 26, 2020</span></li>
          </ul>
          <p>Eligibility criteria for the CERB, CEWS, and CESB is based on employment income for a defined period. All employers should report income and any retroactive payments, including cash and non-cash taxable benefits, made during these periods in&nbsp;2020, regardless of whether or not they applied for and received CEWS.</p>

    <p>Employees who received income supported by a wage subsidy their employer received do not need to take any special action when completing their returns.</p>
    <p>Employment income will appear on the T4 as usual, whether the employer used the wage subsidy to pay the wages or not. Employees should report this income on the individual tax return at line 10100 <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">according to the T4 instructions</a>.</p>
    <p>For 2020 only, employees may have noticed <strong>other information</strong> boxes related to CEWS (codes&nbsp;57, 58, 59, or&nbsp;60) on the T4&nbsp;slip they received in&nbsp;2020. The amounts in these boxes are for information only and do not need to be reported on their tax return.</p>
