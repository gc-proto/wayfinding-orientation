				<p>Gloria owns a gift shop in Ontario.</p>
				<p>Her location was closed due to a COVID-19 related public health order from <span class="nowrap">May 4, 2021</span> to <span class="nowrap">May 12, 2021</span> inclusive. Claim period 8 ended on <span class="nowrap">May 8, 2021.</span></p>
				<p>This means her location was locked down for 9 days total, but:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>5 days occurred in claim period 8</li>
					<li>4 days occurred in claim period 9</li>
				</ul>
				</details>

<p>A public health restriction is an order that meets certain conditions. It must:</p>
<ul>
	<li>be based on an order or decision issued by a federal, provincial, or municipal government, or a local health authority in response to the COVID-19 pandemic</li>
	<li>be limited in scope based on one or more factors such as:
		<ul>
			<li>geographical boundaries</li>
			<li>type of business or other activity</li>
			<li>risks associated with a particular location</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>result in sanctions or be an offence if you do not comply</li>
	<li>require you or your non-arm's-length tenant to stop some or all regular activities at the qualifying property for at least 7 days in a row
		<ul>
			<li>the activities that were stopped must account for at least approximately 25% of the eligible revenues earned during the prior reference period from or in connection with the affected qualifying property</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>An order that restricts or reduces activities but doesn’t require you to close or stop certain activities does not qualify for a lockdown support top-up.</p>
		<p><strong>Examples of restrictions that do not qualify for a lockdown support top-up</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>travel restrictions that reduce the number of clients</li>
	<li>rules about when you can perform your regular activities, such as</li>
	<li>restricted or reduced service hours or hours of operation</li>

	<li>any other restrictions that do not specifically order you to stop or close an activity, such as</li>
	<li>reduced seating capacity or other physical distancing strategies</li>
</ul>

                        <div id="how-25-percent">
                            <p>You must consider the eligible revenue you earned during the prior reference period for the claim period you are applying for to determine if you meet the 25% revenue conditions.</p>
                            <p>A public health restriction and a <strong>qualifying</strong> public health restriction both require that at least approximately 25% of eligible revenue you earned in the prior reference period came from the activities that were required to stop.</p>
                            <p>For a public health restriction, the 25% revenue condition is determined on a qualifying property by qualifying property basis.</p>
                            <p>This means that at least 25% of the eligible revenues earned during the prior reference period from (or in connection with) each affected qualifying property came from the activities that were required to stop.</p>
                            <p>If you have any non-arm’s-length tenants at an affected property, use the eligible revenue they earned from (or in connection with) that property during the prior reference period in your calculation.</p>
                            <p>However, for a <strong>qualifying</strong> public health restriction, the 25% revenue condition is based on your <strong>total</strong> eligible revenue.</p>
                            <p>This means that at least approximately 25% of the <strong>total</strong> eligible revenue earned in the prior reference period came from the activities that were required to stop. When you calculate your total eligible revenue, you must consider all of your eligible revenue, not only eligible revenue from properties that were subject to a public health restriction.</p>
                            <p>If you have any non-arm's-length tenants at <strong>any</strong> of your qualifying properties, include the total eligible revenue they earned during the prior reference period in your calculation.</p>
                            <h5 class="h4">Example</h5>
                            <p>You operate a hairdressing business which has 4&nbsp;locations. Each location is a qualifying property.</p>

                            <p>At the first affected location, all of the eligible revenue you earned at that location during November 2019 came from hairdressing activities. This means that 100% of the eligible revenue you earned at that location came from hairdressing activities:</p>
                            <p>($25,000/$25,000) x 100 = 100%</p>
                            <p>At the other affected location, you earned eligible revenue from hairdressing activities and from selling haircare products: </p>

                            </ul>
                            <p>This means that 60% of the eligible revenue earned at that location during November 2019 came from hairdressing activities:</p>
                            <p>($15,000/$25,000) x 100 = 60%</p>
                            <p>Both of your affected locations meet the 25% revenue condition for a public health restriction for claim period&nbsp;22 because:</p>

                            <p><strong>Step&nbsp;2:</strong> Determine if your business meets the 25% revenue condition required for a <strong>qualifying</strong> public health restriction</p>
                            <p>The total eligible revenue your hairdressing business earned in November 2019 was $100,000:</p>
                            <p>$25,000 x 4 locations = $100,000</p>
                            <p>At the location that was closed, 25% of the total eligible revenue earned by your hair salon in November 2019 came from hairdressing activities:</p>
                            <p>($25,000/$100,000) x 100 = 25%</p>
                            <p>At the other affected location, 15% of the total eligible revenue earned by your hairdressing business in November 2019 came from hairdressing activities:</p>
                            <p>($15,000/$100,000) x 100 = 15%</p>
                            <p>Add the percentages from both of the affected locations. This gives you the total percentage of eligible revenue those locations earned from hairdressing activities in November 2019:</p>
                            <p>(25%) + (15%) = 40%</p>
                            <p>Your hairdressing business meets the 25% revenue condition for a <strong>qualifying</strong> public health restriction for claim period&nbsp;22 because:</p>

                            <p>A <strong>partial</strong> (capacity-limiting) public health restriction has no condition related to eligible revenue.</p>
                            <p>This means that the 50% revenue condition only applies for a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction.</p>
                            <p>A <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction requires that at least approximately 50% of the <strong>total</strong> eligible revenue you earned during the prior reference period came from the activities that were reduced due to a partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction.</p>

                            <p>This example assumes you use the <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="basebaselinecalc" href="#basebaselinecalc">general approach to determine your prior reference <span class="nowrap">period<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a> when calculating your subsidy amounts. Your prior reference period for claim period&nbsp;24 is January&nbsp;2020. This means you will use the eligible revenue you earned from in-person training activities in January&nbsp;2020 for your calculations.</p>

<p>Your 2&nbsp;locations that were subject to a <strong>partial</strong> (capacity-limiting) public health restriction earned $50,000 each in January&nbsp;2020.</p>

<p>Your other 2&nbsp;locations earned $30,000 each in January&nbsp;2020. These are the locations that could operate at full capacity.</p>

<p>The total eligible revenue earned from in-person training activities at your 4&nbsp;locations in January&nbsp;2020 was $160,000:</p>

<p>$50,000 + $50,000 + $30,000 + $30,000 = $160,000</p>

<p>At each of the locations that were subject to a <strong>partial</strong> (capacity-limiting) public health restriction, the limited activities at the location accounted for 31.25% of the total eligible revenue of your corporate training business in January&nbsp;2020:</p>

<p>($50,000/$160,000) x 100 = 31.25%</p>

<p>Add the percentages from both of the affected locations. This gives you the total percentage of eligible revenue earned from those locations in January&nbsp;2020:</p>

<h5 class="h4">Conclusion</h5>

<p>Your corporate training business meets the 50% revenue condition for a <strong>qualifying</strong> partial (capacity-limiting) public health restriction in claim period&nbsp;24 because:</p>
