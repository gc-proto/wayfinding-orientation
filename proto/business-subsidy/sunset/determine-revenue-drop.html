    <li>others' use of your resources</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Generally, you should use your normal accounting method when calculating your eligible revenue. If your normal accounting method is the accrual method, you could <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q12">elect to use the cash method</a> (and vice versa), but once you choose you must use the same accounting method for all your claims.</p>
  <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you chose to use the cash method, you needed to check the “cash method” election box when completing your application.</p>

<h2 id="claim-rev-drop">How the claim period revenue drop was calculated</h2>
<p>You can <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-calculate-amount.html"><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> use the online calculator or spreadsheet to calculate a past claim period revenue drop</a>.</p>
<p>Or, read the details of how the claim period revenue drop was calculated for the wage and rent subsidies as of July 2020.</p>

<details>
  <summary>How the claim period revenue drop was calculated</summary>
  <p>Your claim period revenue drop is the decline in eligible revenue you experienced when comparing your claim period revenue with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
  <p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 – (Claim period revenue / prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
  <h3 id="deeming">Using the current or prior claim period revenue drop (the “deeming rule”)</h3>
  <p>For all wage and rent subsidy applications as of July 5, 2020, you calculated two revenue drops and used the higher result in your base rate calculation. If you use the <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/covid-wage-hiring-support-businesses/wage-calculate-amount.html">online calculator or spreadsheet</a> to calculate your subsidy amount, both rates are calculated when you enter your revenues and the higher rate is automatically applied.</p>

    <p>You must choose one of these prior reference period options and use the same approach when calculating your revenue drop (including any top-up calculations) for all wage and rent subsidy claims that covered July 5, 2020 (CEWS period 5), and later. </p>
	  <p>However, <strong>if you were not operating on March 1, 2019</strong>, you may have elected to use the alternative approach certain claim periods, even if you used the general approach for prior claims.</p>
	 
	  <details>
  <summary>How to use the alternative approach if you were not operating March 1, 2019 </summary>
		  <p>If you normally chose to use the general approach when calculating your revenue drop, you may have made an election to use the alternative approach if you were not carrying on business or otherwise carrying on your ordinary activities on March 1, 2019.</p>
		  <p>If you made an election to use the alternative approach, you must have used this approach for any claims you submit for the following periods:</p>
		  <ul>
			  <li>CRHP, THRP and HHBRP <strong>periods 26 to 28</strong> (February 13 to May 7, 2022) <br> or</li>
			  <li>CEWS and CRHP <strong>periods 14 to 17</strong> (March 14 to July 3, 2021), and CERS <strong>periods 7 to 10</strong> (March 14 to July 3, 2021)</li>
		  </ul>
		<p>For all other periods, you must have continued to use the general approach for your claims.</p>  
		  
	  </details>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you chose to use the alternative prior reference period (January and February 2020), you needed to check the "prior reference period" election box when completing your subsidy application form.</p>
    <p>If you were only operating as a business for part of January and February 2020, read more about <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/cews-frequently-asked-questions.html#q20-2">how to calculate your base revenue drop if you chose the alternative prior reference period</a> in the CEWS technical questions and answers.</p>

<h2 id="12-rev-drop">How the 12-month average revenue drop was calculated</h2>
<p>You only needed to calculate the 12-month average revenue drop <strong>one time</strong>. You used the same 12-month average revenue drop for all of your claims from 22 onward.</p>
<p>You can <a href="/en/revenue-agency/services/wage-rent-subsidies/determine-revenue-drop/calculate-12-month-revenue-drop.html"><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> use the calculator to find your 12-month average revenue drop</a>.</p>
<p>Your 12-month average revenue drop is the average of your applicable monthly revenue drops from March 2020 to February 2021 (CEWS claim period 1 to 13, excluding either claim period 10 or 11).</p>
<p>When calculating your 12-month average revenue drop, include:</p>
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fa-li fas fa-check text-success"></span>claim periods throughout which you were either carrying on your normal activities or were closed because of a public health restriction </li>
</ul>
<p>Do <strong>not</strong> include:</p> 
<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><span class="fas fa-times text-danger fa-li"></span>claim periods in which you weren’t carrying on your normal activities for any length of time in the period for any reason other than due to a <a class="wb-lbx" role="button" aria-controls="qualifying-restriction-content" href="#qualifying-restriction-content">public health <span class="nowrap">restriction<span class="mrgn-lft-sm far fa-question-circle"></span></span></a></li>
</ul>



<h2>Differences between the 12-month average revenue drop and the claim period revenue drop calculation</h2>
<p>If you applied for CEWS periods 1 to 13 or CERS periods 1 to 6, you have already calculated some revenue drops. However, different rules applied to the 12-month average revenue drop calculation and to the claim period revenue drop.</p>
<h3>Include revenue increases</h3>
<p>You must include revenue calculations for all months between March 2020 and February 2021 that relate to claim periods during which you either operated or were not operating due to a public health restriction. This means if any of the months you calculate had a revenue <strong>increase</strong> instead of a drop, you must include it as part of your 12-month average calculation. </p>
<h3>Deeming rule does not apply</h3>
<p>Unlike the claim period revenue drop, there is no deeming rule for the 12-month average revenue drop that allows you to use the better of two rates. You must include the actual revenue drop calculation for each claim period. </p>
<p>If you did not claim CEWS or CERS for some periods, you must still calculate the revenue drop for those claim periods and include those amounts when determining your 12-month average revenue drop if you were operating (or were closed due to a public health restriction) in those claim periods.</p>

              <li>Calculate your revenue drop for each of those claim periods </li>

  <p>To calculate your revenue drop for each month, compare that month's revenue (the “calculation month”) with your revenue from a specific period of time prior to March 2020 (the “prior reference period”):</p>
  <p><span class="fas fa-calculator text-muted"></span> <strong>Revenue drop (%) = 1 − (calculation month revenue ÷ prior reference period revenue)</strong></p>
  <p>This is your revenue drop for one month.</p>
  <p><strong>Important</strong>: if any of the months you calculate had a revenue <strong>increase</strong> instead of a drop, you must still include those months in your average. This means if you had <strong>higher</strong> revenue in the calculation month than you did in the prior reference period you’re using to calculate the revenue drop, it would result in a negative number. Any such negative revenue drops (revenue increases) must be included when calculating your 12-month average.</p>
  <h3 id="#">Prior reference period options</h3>
  <div id="">
  <p>Like the calculation for the claim period revenue drop, the same two options for prior reference period comparisons can be used when calculating your 12-month average, the general approach or the alternative approach.</p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> If you were only using the alternative approach to calculate the revenue drop for the months of March to June 2020 as part of your 12-month average revenue drop calculation, you did not need to check the box for the election related to using the alternative method to calculate your revenue drop when completing your subsidy application.

<h3>Examples of a 12-month revenue drop calculation</h3>
<details>
<summary>Example: Calculating a 12-month average revenue drop as a seasonal business</summary>
<p>Teshia's food truck is normally open from March to October, and does not operate in the winter. Since the food truck was not operating from November to February because it was their regular seasonal closure and not due to a public health restriction that required them to close, Teshia will not include those claim periods  in the calculation. </p>
<p>To calculate the 12-month revenue drop, Teshia will:</p>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li>Total the number of claim periods from March 2020 to February 2021 in which they were operating: <strong>8</strong> (March 15 to October 24, 2020)</li>
<li>Determine the revenue drop for each of the remaining months:
  <ul>
    <li>March 2020 over March 2019: <strong>95.05%</strong></li>
    <li>April 2020 over April 2019: <strong>78.33%</strong></li>
    <li>May 2020 over May 2019: <strong>60.15%</strong></li>
    <li>June 2020 over June 2019: <strong>29.08%</strong></li>
    <li>July 2020 over July 2019: <strong>-5.05%</strong> (increase)</li>
    <li>August 2020 over August 2019: <strong>42.22%</strong></li>
    <li>September 2020 over September 2019: <strong>48.83%</strong></li>
    <li>October 2020 over October 2019: <strong>61.08%</strong></li>
  </ul>
  Teshia chooses the general approach to calculate the revenue drops because they were not operating in January and February of 2020.</li>
<li>Add the drops together: 409.69%</li>
<li>Divide by the number of operational claim periods (8): <strong>51.21%</strong></li>

<p>Teshia's resulting 12-month average revenue drop is 51.21%, which is high enough to meet the 12-month average revenue drop eligibility requirement for the THRP (40% or greater) or the HHBRP (50% or greater). Teshia has already determined that the food truck meets the definition of a qualifying tourism and hospitality entity, making the THRP a better option because it provides a higher rate of subsidy. Although Teshia will need to calculate the business’s revenue drop for each claim period to determine its THRP eligibility for that claim period, this 12-month average revenue drop only needs to be calculated once. </p>
</ol></details>
<details>
<summary>Example: Calculating a 12-month average revenue drop when you've claimed a subsidy in the past</summary>
<p>Ravi's book store opened in June 2019. He has no employees to make a wage subsidy claim, but has a qualifying property with qualifying expenses to make a CERS claim. Therefore, he applied for the CERS as soon as it became available after September 27, 2020.</p>
<p>Because Ravi has applied for CERS in the past, he has already calculated revenue drops for the months of October 2020 to February 2021.</p>
<p>Ravi chose the general approach when calculating his CERS revenue drops, so he must use the general approach when calculating his revenue drops for the 12-month average from July 2020 onward.  Even though he did not qualify for any subsidy from March 2020 to June 2020 (CEWS claim periods 1 to 4), he must determine which approach to use to calculate the revenue drops for these periods. Because Ravi was not in carrying on his business on March 1, 2019, he cannot use the general approach and must use the alternative approach to calculate the revenue drop for these periods.</p>
<p>To calculate the 12-month revenue drop, Ravi will:</p>
<ol class="lst-stps">
<li>Calculate his revenue drops for March to June, 2020 (corresponding to CEWS claim periods 1 to 4), using the alternative approach:</li>

<!--0l-->
<p>Ravi's resulting 12-month average revenue drop is 41.37%.</p>
<p>This revenue drop would be high enough to meet the 12-month average revenue drop eligibility requirement for a qualifying tourism or hospitality entity to apply for a rent subsidy through the THRP (40% or greater). However, because Ravi has determined that his business is not considered a qualifying tourism or hospitality entity, he is <strong>not</strong> able to apply for the THRP under this set of conditions.</p>
<p>This revenue drop also disqualifies him from applying for a rent subsidy through the HHBRP, which needs a 12-month average revenue drop of 50% or greater. </p>
<p>If Ravi’s business faces a qualifying public health restriction during a claim period in the future, he may still be able to apply. He would still need to calculate his claim period revenue drop to see if he can apply for a rent subsidy through the THRP under that set of conditions, but his 12-month average revenue drop does not need to be considered in that case. </p>
