			<h2>Subsidies you may qualify for under the HHBRP</h2>
			<!--<p>If you meet the qualifications for the HHBRP, you will qualify for preferential rates for the wage and rent subsidies.</p>-->
<p>Through the HHBRP, you may be able to get a subsidy to help cover wages (formerly the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy) and rent (formerly the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy).</p>
