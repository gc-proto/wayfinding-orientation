    <h2 id="h-1">When to report the CEWS on your return</h2>
    <p>The Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS) is considered government assistance and is taxable, unless you are exempt from income tax. As an employer who received CEWS, you must report the subsidy on your income tax or information return for the tax year (fiscal period) in which you are considered to have received it.</p>
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <p>The CEWS is <strong>generally considered to have been received on the last day of the claim period it relates to</strong>. </p>
      <p>For example, if you applied for and received the wage subsidy for claim period 10 (November 22 to December 19, 2020), we would consider you to have received the amount on December 19, 2020, even if you applied for period 10 in 2021 or received your subsidy amount for period 10 in 2021.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="h-2">How to report the CEWS on your return</h2>
    <p>How you report the CEWS on your tax or information return depends on the type of employer you are.</p>
    <p>You may be able to elect to reduce your related wage expenses by the amount of government assistance (CEWS) you received. Otherwise, you have to include the assistance in your income. </p>
    <h3 id="h-2-1">Corporations</h3>
    <p>Enter the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 295 of Schedule 1 of your T2 Corporation Income Tax Return and write “Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy” on the corresponding line 605.</p>
    <p>If you are a member of a partnership, you must reflect any CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 129, “Income or loss for tax purposes – partnerships”.</p>
    <p>Do not include amounts of CEWS you received for the tax year under item 8242 of the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>
    <p>Related form: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2sch1.html">Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes (T2SCH1)</a></p>
    <h3 id="h-2-2">Trusts</h3>
    <p>Include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 19, “Other income” of your T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return.</p>
    <p>If you are a member of a partnership, you should also enter any CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you on line 19.</p>
    <p>Related form: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3ret.html">T3 Trust Income Tax and Information Return (T3RET)</a></p>
    <h3 id="h-2-3">Partnerships</h3>
    <p>Report CEWS amounts you received as income on your partnership information return form T5013SCH1, Net Income (Loss) for Income Tax Purposes – Schedule 1. </p>
    <p>As a member of a partnership, you must reflect any CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you in the amount you enter on line 109, “Income or loss for tax purposes from partnerships”.</p>
    <p>Enter the total CEWS amount the partnership received for the fiscal period on any of lines 290 to 294 and write “Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy” on whichever of lines 600 to 604 corresponds to the line used to enter the amount.</p>
    <p>Do not include amounts of CEWS the partnership received for the fiscal period under item 8242 of the General Index of Financial Information (GIFI).</p>

    <h3 id="h-2-4">Individual employers</h3>
    <p>If you are an individual who has received a CEWS amount as an eligible employer, you will report the total amount you received on the statement of activities form(s) that apply to your situation.</p>
    <h4>Sole proprietors (unincorporated, self-employed individuals) and partners in a business partnership</h4>
    <p>Include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 8230, “Other income” of form T2125, Statement of Business or Professional Activities. </p>
    <h4>Self-employed farmers</h4>
    <p>Include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 9600, “Other income” of form T2042, Statement of Farming Activities.</p>
    <h4>Self-employed fishers</h4>
    <p>Include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 9600, “Other income” of form T2121, Statement of Fishing Activities.</p>
    <h4>Partners in a partnership</h4>
    <p>If you are a partner in a partnership that <strong>has</strong> to file a partnership information return, the CEWS amount included in the partnership’s income and allocated to you will be in the amount at box 114 of your T5013, Statement of Partnership Income slip. Enter this amount at line 14000 of your income tax return.</p>
    <p>If you are a partner in a partnership that does <strong>not</strong> have to file a partnership information return, include the CEWS amount on the appropriate line of form T2125, form T2042, or form T2121, whichever applies. For more information on completing the statement of activities form that applies to you as a partner in a business, farming, or fishing partnership, see guide T4002, Self-employed Business, Professional, Commission, Farming, and Fishing Income.</p>

    <h3 id="h-2-5">Tax-exempt employers</h3>
    <p>If you are an income tax-exempt entity (such as a registered charity or a non-profit organization) that has received a CEWS amount as an eligible employer, you may have to report the total amount you received on the information return (if any) that applies to your situation, even though this amount is not taxable to you.</p>
    <h4>Registered charities</h4>
    <p>Use the T3010, Registered Charity Information Return, to report a CEWS amount you received as income.</p>
    <p>If you are a registered charity that does not have to complete Schedule 6, you can report CEWS amounts you received as income by checking “Yes” at line 4565, “Did the charity receive any revenue from any level of government in Canada?” of Section D and including the total CEWS amount you received for the fiscal period on line 4570.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, include the total CEWS amount you received for the tax year on line 4540, “Total revenue received from federal government” of Schedule 6.</p>
    <p>Related form: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t3010.html">Registered  Charity Information Return (T3010)</a></p>
    <h4>Registered Canadian amateur athletic association</h4>
    <p>There is no particular line on form T2052, Registered Canadian Amateur Athletic Association Information Return, to report the CEWS. The financial statements for the fiscal period covered by the return should indicate the different sources of revenue in enough detail to show how funds were spent and invested.</p>
    <p>Related form: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/forms-publications/forms/t2052.html">Registered Canadian Amateur Athletic Association Information Return (T2052)</a></p>
    <h4>Other tax-exempt eligible employers</h4>
    <p>If your organization is required to file the T1044, Non-profit Organization (NPO) Information Return, include the total CEWS amount your organization received for the tax year on line 101, “Federal, provincial, and municipal grants and payments” of your  NPO Information Return. For more information on whether the organization you represent has to file a NPO Information Return, see guide T4117, Income Tax Guide to the Non-Profit Organization (NPO) Information Return.</p>

    <h2 id="h-6">Employees report income as usual</h2>
    <p>Employees who received income supported by CEWS do not need to take any special action when completing their returns.</p>
    <p>Employment income will appear on the T4 as usual, whether the employer used the CEWS to pay the wages or not. Employees should report this income on the individual tax return at line 10100 <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/individuals/topics/about-your-tax-return/tax-return/completing-a-tax-return/tax-slips/understand-your-tax-slips/t4-slips/t4-statement-remuneration-paid.html">according to the T4 instructions</a>. </p>
    <p>Employees may see <strong>other information</strong> boxes related to CEWS (codes 57, 58, 59, or 60) on the T4 slip they receive. These boxes are for information only and do not need to be reported on their tax return.</p>
    <p>There are no T4A slips issued for CEWS, as there are for COVID benefits paid directly to individuals.</p>
