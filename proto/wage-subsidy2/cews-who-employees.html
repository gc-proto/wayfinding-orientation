               <p>An eligible employee is a person who was employed by you (the eligible employer) in Canada during the claim period.</p>
               <p>For <strong>claim periods 1 to 4</strong>, you can’t include employees who had 14 or more consecutive unpaid days in the period. However, <strong>for periods 5 and later</strong>, you no longer have to exclude these employees from your calculation.</p>
               <p>Employee eligibility depends on the person being <strong>employed</strong> in Canada, not living in Canada.</p>
               <h3 id="retro">Retroactively hiring and paying employees</h3>
               <p>Employees you laid off can become eligible retroactively, as long as you rehire and pay them so they meet the eligibility criteria for the claim period. You must rehire and pay these employees before you include them in your subsidy claim.</p>
